This does take K cups and ground coffee and makes a good cup of coffee. The only issue is the time it takes to brew, particularly ground coffee. I can brew 3 or 4 cups in a Keurig in the time it takes to brew one on this unit. Sometimes that won't matter to me, sometimes it's just inconvenient. The only other issue I've had is in cleaning up after brewing ground coffee. The basket drips forever after you remove your full mug, then - when you remove the basket - it still has significant liquid in it. You can and do make a mess dumping it. It does not drain completely. I think the designers didn't include enough screen to fully drain. Otherwise the unit is as advertised. Coffee is good. No plastic taste. Easy to clean.

However, I was willing to give it a shot and try a product that wasn't the cheapest but also not the most expensive. I was hoping, more than anything, to have an easy way to make a hot single-serve cup of coffee each morning. The machine is relatively easy to use, however, the first cup I've brewed came out barely lukewarm and watery. It was nearly transparent, and I filled the container with ground coffee to its max line.

Not only is the quality of the coffee pretty bad, but the machine itself has some flaws. It comes with a tiny water filter and a plastic container it sits in. I read the instructions about how to properly insert the water filter into the water tank, however, it doesn't click into the water tank at all. Once you fill the tank with water, the water filter floats up to the top. After messing with it and pushing down on it hard for a good 15 minutes, I gave up. Overall, pretty disappointed, and I intend on returning it. Not worth paying full price for this. Guess it's back to using my old Mr. Coffemate coffee maker.","Size: 40 oz., 3 Brewing Options  Color: Black",true,false,
R2IUXIN2401PJX," Filter doesn't hold as much coffee as my previous model that didn't have the reservoir",lukn2lrn,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHVYNWR6B362DOJCH7NIWEGN3MCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,3,"November 21, 2020","For those of you who may have had a previous model, and liked to make a 16 oz cup using 1/4 c of coffee, as was my formula, this machine will not allow you to do that. Granted, the old machine stated that 14 oz was the max, and the max line for coffee in the filter basket was far less than 1/4 c, but at least you could get away with it. I do have a hack, however, to be able to use 1/4 cup of ground coffee. I just exchanged the gray piece that has the piercing pin, and the filter basket with my old ones from the older model. I can now put 1/4 c of coffee in the basket, and it worked fine. The max cup of coffee that I could brew, however, was 14 oz. But I can live with that.

I'm undecided as to whether I want to keep this machine. While it is nice to have the water reservoir that I can fill up either at my sink, or from my filtered water dispenser from my refrigerator, it isn't that much more convenient than filling my old machine each time. Not only that, it takes about 30 secs and makes a lot of noise when it pulls the 14 oz from the reservoir into the machine. It is loud enough that it would probably interfere with any phone call I'm on, if I'm on speaker, while making my coffee.

Another benefit of the old machine without the reservoir is that as long as I filled the machine with water from the cup that I was brewing into, I couldn't make a mistake of using too small of a cup. On this machine, you have to be awake enough in the morning to make sure your cup selection matches the cup size that you are using.

Finally, I ran the water through 3X before using, and one the 3rd time I noticed that there was a sliver of plastic that made its way into my cup. So, I ran it through one more time, and it was clear. Hopefully, no more leftover plastic shavings will be found.","Size: 40 oz., 3 Brewing Options  Color: Black",true,false,

When I use my coffee pods with this Single Hamilton Beach I get barely flavored water even on the lowest cup size and on bold brew. This is not what I was hoping for.

*Adding a six month update. Its older, dirtier, and brews a little slower but it has also held up like a champ. Still a good hot cup of coffee and too easy.

I have brewed about 5 cups now, 2 k cups and 3 ground coffee, and 1 bold brew. Everything works really well and honestly props to the design team on this one. There are very niche things that I thought would be a minor inconvenience that ended up being well designed instead. For example, the water can be taken out, which is normal, but it stands upright if you need to set it somewhere to fill it up. The funnel and front-opening design of the k cup slot or coffee slot is also super easy to access and stress free

Biggest complaint for people: It takes time to brew
Like I mentioned I went from a mr coffee to this, and the mr coffee made coffee a lot faster
But the taste was absolutely terrible and I used to think it was the ground coffee's fault
Come to find out, this maker makes way tastier coffee with less grounds used.
SO yeah, it takes longer to brew, but I would take that over a fast brew cup of terrible coffee any day. I dont see how people have been complaining about that

Also grounds leaking into your cup / spilling out of the machine
If you have a brain, this wont happen. People who have had spilling issues did not read the instructions about flushing out the system if you stop a brew mid way, and grounds getting into your cup usually means your coffee is finer than the filter (Use a coarser grind). To be honest though, even with fine coffee there was minimal leakage into the cup

We replaced this device with another brand. HOWEVER, we did find the PERFECT use case for this device. It doesn't store water, and it doesn't keep the water preheated, so it's PERFECT in our RV. No water to go bad between trips, and no wasted electricity when we're running off of battery power.
This is a super simple to use little coffee maker and it brews a decent cup of coffee. That being said, the reservoir is made of super thin plastic and it cracked the second time that I pulled it off to fill it, so use a pitcher or something and fill it, don't remove it, it won't stand up to it. Also, this coffee maker is energy efficient, I guess, because it does not preheat any water. When you push the buttons to make a cup of coffee, that's when it fills the interior water tank and heats the water. As a result it takes FOREVER to brew a cup of coffee. Go read a book, take a nap, something, because you'll get bored waiting for your cup. (And subsequent cups don't go any faster, it doesn't like ""warm up"" and then go faster. It's cold water in... heat it... make coffee.... cold water in... heat it.... make coffee.)

I cleaned everything. I inspected the k-cups and discovered that my coffee grinds were dry. For some reason, the water wasn't running through the grinds. I sent pictures and a video to the manufacturer, Hamilton Beach.

They responded with the following: ""The provided troubleshooting steps have been tested and proved by our  engineering  team. The use of bottled water and use with different k cups brands have been shown to resolve the occurrence with your appliance.
The warranty is in place for appliances that may present an issue and will need to be replaced. The occurrence you have experienced  is resolved by the use of bottled and use of different k-cups. Unfortunately, a warranty claim is not submitted for this occurrence.""

My coffee maker doesn't work with any brand of k-cup. Their recommendation is that I use bottled water. I've never had this issue before and every other coffee maker I own seems to work just fine without bottled water.

Cons: SLOW brewing. I can make my bed in the morning while waiting for it to brew. The drip container that the cup sits on holds minimal amount. If you forget to put your cup on or use too small a cup, you have a real mess.

As others have said, it's slow to brew. The reason for this is because it only heats up the water once you tell it to brew. This probably saves a lot of energy, so it's more of a design decision than a problem with the device.

Hamilton Beach is a brand I've purchased other products of and never had any issues too. When the product arrived the whole thing was in a plastic bag and it was all wet inside the bag not on the outside. I'm guessing they water test the unit and somehow it got wet and they just packed it up. I was alarmed, but luckily it didn't have any mildew odor or any other smell, but I thoroughly cleaned every piece of the unit with detergent and water and ran some vinegar through it and several water only runs to make sure it was safe.

I've used this unit for several weeks now and so far it doesn't take long for it to make a cup of coffee at all. I've used both k-cups and coffee grounds and the gadget performes well using either. I do wish the ground coffee basket was slightly larger because I like my coffee pretty strong, but it doesn't make this not worth checking out. I also have seen some different devices that have the water reservoir on the side which would probably be slightly more convenient because I have to pull it away from under my cupboards to refill and reach my head around to see the water level, but it's just a minor inconvenience, though it could have swayed my decision if I would have thought about it at the time.

The cup predetermined cup sizes seem to slightly vary every brew because using the same cup I'll notice the fill level will sometimes be slightly different, this only matters because I add creamer to my coffee and sometimes have to pour a little out to have enough room for my desired amount of creamer.

The coffee comes out pretty hot, perfect temperature for me because I don't like having to wait for my coffee to cool some before sipping, but some might want it a little hotter.

Overall this unit does perform very well, and I'm content with having it. I might have chosen a different one if I would have foreseen the small issues I have, but I'll be using this without a real problem.","Size: Hot &amp; Iced Coffee, 50 oz.

RAEJ2I80EAAXH," Got this to replaced my Keurig K-Slim + ICED coffee maker",Jaime Hayden,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHLK45JZNCUJVSULHPGAP6L6BHMA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4,"April 20, 2023","Prior to this, I was using a Keurig K-Slim + ICED coffee maker which I used for the last 3 years but it slipped out of my hand while moving things around in my kitchen and it fell on the floor but wouldn't turn back on after that which saddened me great deal because I really love my iced coffee. I was so excited when I came across this Hamilton Beach FlexBrew coffee machine because it's not only compatible with the K cups I already had on hand, but it also brews iced coffee which I absolutely love! I'm not sure if it uses the same technology as the Keurig machine (starts with hotter water to help extract full flavor, then cools down for less ice melt) but the first cup of iced coffee I made with this machine tasted great so I'm extremely happy with this coffee machine!

At first I thought there was something wrong with the door to access the brew basket. I thought it seemed to be bit stiff when opening it but then a couple days later I realized there was a small lever at the button that you push towards you to open. I was used to my Keurig machine which you just pulled up with no lever.

I'm not a big fan of the design for their drip tray. I do like that it can be used to hide the K cup or brew basket depending on what you are using at the time, but I don't like the small grooves where the coffee drips. I wish it could be pulled apart to make sure it's being cleaned thoroughly. My Keurig drip tray came apart into 2 pieces which made it very easy to clean it thoroughly.

My biggest complaint with this product is with the design for the water basin. When you have to carry it back & forth from the kitchen sink it can be a little tricky because the handle in the back is so small it feels like it wants to slip out of your hands and I have small hands so I could see someone with larger hands not being a fan of this design.","Size: Hot &amp; Iced Coffee, 50 oz.

This Hamilton Beach single-serve coffee maker has a price point of $80, or at the higher range of average. At this price, you would expect some nice technology and a machine featuring good finishes. Overall, this unit has some very good features, but some finish and cheap fabrication issues combine to make this an average machine...a daily work horse that has foregone any nice embellishments.

Of course, it has some very good features that make this worthy of a purchase consideration. As a single-brew machine, it does give you the option to use a K-cup pod and also includes an adapter for you to fill with your own coffee. That is a nice touch. Like many single-cup machines, you are given the option of how many ounces you want to brew for your cup...from 8 oz up to 14 oz. There is an iced coffee function that allows you to remove the coffee mug stand in order to fit a larger size glass to hold your ice and drip coffee. Looking at these features alone, this is a decent unit that should serve your household for a long period of time.

However, most coffee drinkers store their coffee makers out on their kitchen counter...always in plain view. Because of this, some competitor models will add a satin finish, use better plastics, add metal bands and face plates and more... in an effort to make their units more classy so they look nice in addition to working well. For this appliance, Hamilton Beach did not go all out. The plastic used has a cheap look to it and the finish of our unit had dull spots and uneven color areas. The plastic used for the cup rest is not the hard plastic used by some competitors. While these finish details don't impact the operation of the brewer or the taste of the coffee, they affect the aesthetics of what rests on top of the counter.

In this review, this brewer gets four stars because it is a decent coffee machine. We've taken away one star because of the inattention to finish.","Size: Hot &amp; Iced Coffee, 50 oz.  Color: Black",false,true,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CBKEnG10L.jpg

If you use a pod pack, this machine will be very fast and simple to use and to make multiple cups without cleanup. I use it with grounds, so you do have to clean out the basket after each use. No big deal and worth it for freshly ground beans.

There are only size selections, not strength. So the flow of water appears to be a single speed only. I wish there was a bold selection to slow the flow a bit and make an even stronger cup. This is not an inexpensive unit and that addition would have made it great. It's really the only reason I gave it a 4 star.

The shape and position (back of unit) makes it look smaller. The instructions say to have a minimum of 16 ounces in the tank which would make the useful reservoir only 34 oz, but it did not stop brewing when the tank was almost empty. Overall, the footprint is much smaller than the classic ""K"" model, though having the water tank in the back could be more cumbersome to fill. BUT, it is so much easier to get off since it just slides in place. With the ""K"" model, you have to kind of angle it in - often spilling the water on the counter. I use a container to fill my because it is such a pain. The ""K"" model also has a filter which this one does not - don't know if that is good or bad, but it makes the ""K"" model near impossible to clean. There is only the tiny valve at the bottom of this and the shape is much easier to work with. The temperature is not adjustable like the ""K"" classic, and comes out about the same at about 170 degrees when it fills a ceramic cup (the second time). The part that holds the coffee pod (or the included refillable pod) does not snap in place like on the ""K"" brand, making it easier to clean. It is a little noisier than the ""K"" model, but not so much that it is annoying. My unit actually had water in it when I opened the box - hopefully from testing but I would think they would want to make sure it was dry before packaging! The price is much less than a similar ""K"" model as well.","Size: Hot &amp; Iced Coffee, 50 oz.  Color: Black",false,true,

I had a fully furnished apartment and it came with one of these coffee makers. I came to love being able to brew coffee directly into my 16 ounce yeti tumbler on my way out the door, perfect for those dark starts to my work day. I first started using k-cups but found that the provided filter for ground coffee worked much better giving me a great cup of coffee and saving the expense of the K-cups as well. This unit is simple to operate, just place the k-cup into the hopper, close the lid and hit either the 12 or 14 ounce button, about a minute and a half later you'll have a nice cup of coffee. The same applies if your using the provided filter to brew ground coffee. If your grinding your own coffee, make sure that you grind for drip coffee, any thing finer will result in a mess. This unit is nice and compact as well, so it will take less counter top space than other K-cup capable models out there. I typically do not drink iced coffee, so can't speak for that functionality.

As I don't particularly care for the coffee offered at work and would rather not drown my coffee in creamer, I decided to get this to use at my desk so I can make coffee of my choosing. There is a kitchen area so filling the reservoir with water & rinsing the coffee grounds filter is not a problem.

This machine has a 40 oz water reservoir so you don't need to refill after every cup as my current home machine does.
So that is 5 8oz or 4 10oz or 2 14 oz servings before you need to refill. You can fill a bit above the max line. The bottom removable tray is also storage for the K-cup adapter or coffee ground adapter.

There is the option for regular brew or bold. I believe the bold setting makes the water a little hotter. Either way you get a hot cup of coffee every time.

This takes about 3 minutes to make a 8oz, 3 1/2 to make a 10 and about 5 to make a 14. This is measured from when you hit the brew button until this stops making noise and the brew light goes out. You can take about 15 seconds off this to when you can remove your cup. I was hoping this would be quicker then my FlexBrew 2-way when using the single side, but when running both head to head they finish within a few seconds of each other.
(I was hoping with this being a dedicated machine it would be a little quicker then my current machine. )

The largest cup you can place under the dispenser with the bottom removed is 7 1/2 inches. I am able to run 2 14oz cycles into my 32oz cup as I show in my 4th picture. Plenty of coffee for the drive or ride to work.

Before you use this to make coffee to drink, run several 14oz cycles until the hot water you get is clear. I was seeing tiny black flakes in the water for several cycles. I am thinking this is Teflon bits coming off the heating element after manufacturing & by doing this you clear out the debris. It did get less & less. After 4 cups of clear water I figured it was good to go.

For single servings I do like this over my 2-way. As you fill the reservoir on the side, you have water available for several cups. You also can select the amount you want by a button. On the 2-way you fill the reservoir with how much you want to make & need to do this for every cup.

This is not programmable so you will need to press the brew button to make your coffee in the morning instead of this having it ready for you when you wake up (not an issue for myself).
You will need to clean up water from time to time with a rag or paper towel under where the reservoir sits as a little can leak when you are removing or replacing the water tank on the side.

This is not that much smaller then the FlexBrew 2-way maker. If you want or need a new coffee maker for both full size pots & the ability to use k-cups or make single servings, spend a little extra and get the FlexBrew 2-way maker.

If all you need is a a single cup maker for home or office, this is a great and flexible (and cheaper) alternative to a Keurig or other single coffee makers. I am enjoying using this at work.","Size: 40 oz., 3 Brewing Options  Color: Black",false,true,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C1eHSAuAL.jpg

The coffee does not come out hot. Not sure if it’s a defect on mine but every time, I have to microwave the cup to make it decently warm afterwards. A nitpick, but it also doesn’t have any indicator (sound or otherwise) to let you know when the coffee is ready.

The machine itself works beautifully. It makes an 8 oz. cup of coffee in about 2 minutes with the ""bold"" feature enabled. Perhaps it's this speed that prevents the water from staying in contact with the grounds long enough to absorb the flavor. I did find that if I load the container a bit above the maximum line, I can get an acceptable cup of coffee, and I don't see a downside such as an overflow. The grounds container has a locking lid that is extremely difficult for me to open, but that's my only complaint about the functionality of the brewer.

I thought I'd try the K-cup feature to see if I could get better results using the Starbucks dark French Roast. Again, the 8 oz cup with the bold feature enabled took 2 minutes at most, and the result was very good, similar to the Keurig brewer after a few uses; I think the machine needed a few more uses than recommended when first setting up the machine.

The cup stand is large enough to store either the K-cup or the ground coffee holder underneath when not in use. I expected that the center of the stand is where I should place the cup; however, the machine pours from the back, and if you put your cup in the center, the coffee will pour out onto the stand and leave a (literally) hot mess to clean up.

I have had it set up for a few weeks now and it has been working great!

I mainly use ground coffee with the FlexBrew and it has been working well, but I do wish it either came with more than one grounds basket or Hamilton Beach actually sold more baskets. You just need to be diligent in rinsing out the basket right after use so it's available again for another cup. In this way, the K-cups can be more convenient if you want to make multiple cups back-to-back.

The reservoir is a nice feature to have and I keep mine stocked with distilled water so I don't have a lot of hard water build up in the machine. The reservoir can be removed from the machine to move under a faucet if needed and then placed back on the machine. The mechanism that holds the reservoir could be better, as I don't feel like it is super secure, but it has been working fine so far.

One thing to note is the stand where you place your cup to receive the coffee: it is not a circle and instead oblong.

When using 8oz and the bold setting, I find that this brews a strong, rich, and flavorful cup of coffee. It brews very quickly, just around 90 seconds or so to get a fresh cup of coffee.

It's a bit noisy, but not bad considering how quickly it brews. I also like that it comes with a reusable k-cup pod for filling with your own ground coffee.

I'll keep it simple.
While the brewer takes slightly longer to work and is a little noisy at the beginning and end of the process, it makes a better cup of coffee. This may be because the temperature of the cup you make is higher than you get with Keurig and, when you use the strong (bold?) brew setting you can actually taste the difference, something I never noticed with the other brand. Here, my guess is that the delivery of the water through the pod is slower and more measured generates this result. The freedom to easily use your own ground coffee very simply is a plus.
Are there negatives? Gee, it doesn't have a clock. Oh, and the reservoir is only about 60% the size of my old Keurig (a very slight bother for the lazy). Boo Hoo. Weigh the pluses and minuses. Make your choice. I'll admit that the noise factor a mentioned at the start may be the result of some sort of friction, which could mean that the brewer won't last forever---but neither did my Keurigs and I'll happily take my chances.","Size: 40 oz., 3 Brewing Options  Color: Black",false,false,

There is so much I actually liked about this coffeemaker, especially the fact I could use either k-cups or regular ground coffee. I liked the fact that it had a fill tank of 40 oz, or 4 cups of coffee before I had to refill. It takes up a bit more counter space than my one-cup Mr. Coffee keurig coffee maker, but that was OK with me. All that said, at this point I am either going to give away the coffeemaker (with warning) or throw it away because I have done everything I can, and everything recommended by the manufacturer, to get rid of a horrid plastic/chemical taste. I read the manual and followed instructions to wash the coffeemaker out with hot soapy water, rinse well, etc. Then I followed their instructions to get of the bad taste by running vinegar through the coffeemaker. In fact, I followed that procedure twice, rinsing well with clean water after. I am sad to say it didn't work. I contacted the manufacturer via their web site to tell them what I'd done, and ask for further suggestions. Their return email simply sent me the instructions on running vinegar through the pot. I sent a return email to explain (again) that I'd already tried the vinegar process, but that it didn't work, and to ask, again, for any further suggestions. The return email simply said No, Sorry. And, despite knowing I was going to review this coffeemaker for Amazon Vine, they offered no solution. This isn't just a faint ""new"" plastic taste. This chemical taste makes the coffee undrinkable. I even took the appliance apart and let it ""air out"" on my counter for several days, then re-washed it, then ran the vinegar process again -- to no avail. Both coffee and tea are undrinkable.
I don't like to give negative reviews, especially when I'm receiving a product for free in exchange for my review, but I'm always going to be honest.

We ordered this Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffee Maker, since it’s just him. He’s been using it for a couple of weeks already and loves it.
Some of the things he likes most are, the versatility of being able to use pods or coffee grounds with a simple change of the basket, since he doesn’t always have the extra Money for the pods. He also likes that the parts are removable so that it can be washed with ease, and like most younger men doesn’t care much for cleaning.
Some things my Wife noticed as a longtime Coffee drinker is the purge button that clears any remaining water out of the inside of the coffee maker and unlike other pod coffee makers the needle can be removed to be cleaned of debree which can cause them not to work.
There is however one Negative which is why we’re giving 4 Stars, this particular model does seem to take a bit longer than your average pod coffee makers.","Size: 40 oz., 3 Brewing Options  Color: Black",false,true,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710NCCA34nL.jpg

Huh, people are now too lazy to even make a simple cup of coffee, I thought. But I saw more and more of them, and then I had the opportunity to test a single-cup brewer in my home. I went through the supplied sample pods, bought some more, and before long I was regularly buying K-cup pods in different blends and brands, and I was really enjoying it. It doesn’t cost that much, and it’s a lot more convenient that having to grind a tablespoon of beans every morning and run them through a Melita filter or French press, not to mention a lot neater, and probably a lot less wasteful. Most of the K-cups I was buying had really good, fresh, coffee in them, too. In fact, the only drawback to my new coffeemaker was that the reservoir had to be refilled for every cup, which was very inconvenient when I had company over. This Hamilton Beach K-cup brewer promised to solve that problem. It’s easy to use, and thanks to the water reservoir it can produce coffee fast enough for at least a small gathering without making anyone wait too long. Controls are simple: Choose the cup size, and hit one of the two brew buttons to choose the strength. (It also has the ability to connect with your smart phone and automatically order coffee for you, a function that might make sense on an ink jet printer but that I don’t see using in a coffee maker.) And if you do feel like grinding your own beans, it comes with three reusable K-cups that you can fill with your own blends. It’s been in daily use on my kitchen counter for about three weeks now without any problems.","Size: 40 oz., 3 Brewing Options  Color: Black",false,true,

I use it in my office at work and it does the job splendidly. Can be used for Keurig cups and grind. The grind filter is made not of plastic but more like rubber. It holds the form easily but will not crack when dropped. It has an O-ring as seal, so no messes. It can handle up to 3 Tbsp of ground coffee but I usually use less since the unit itself has a 'regular' and 'bold' setting. I drink my coffee black and it tastes great. The water storage is for up to 40 oz, the possible dispensed volumes are 8, 10, and 14 oz. There is also a cautionary mark for minimum 14 oz but you can still make 8 or 10 oz if you still have that much water left. Cleaning is very easy, all parts are well designed for it. Some technical information: With the spacer in place, maximum cup height is about 12.5 cm. Without the spacer its about 20 cm. The girth is almost irrelevant. I have a really wide cup and it fits nicely. The depth of the stand is 10.5 cm. Brew time for 8 oz regular is 3:15 minutes, for 14 oz regular 4:40 minutes and for 14 oz bold 5:10 minutes. If you only use the insert for the Keurig cups, this unit can also be used to just make hot water for tea. One last thing, for curiosity, I checked the price for replacements and found that they are very affordable, which I really appreciated. So, all in all, I really love the machine.

I use reusable K-cups so I can use regular coffee and save on cost. For some reason, they tend to be rather inconsistent with that Keurig machine and were causing a lot of frustration. This machine is far better. The reservoir is nice and if you do 10oz cups, you can get four servings before refilling. You get two inserts, one that holds K-cups and one that holds coffee grounds (a reusable filter). I love this. Also, you can fill 14oz travel mugs from this as well. So far, I've had no problems with it.

If there's not enough water in the reservoir, it just stops until you add more, then it takes enough to finish whatever size you were trying to make. There is an option to brew regular or brew bold. I'm not sure how it treats them differently, but it does seem to accomplish exactly what it claims. My only problem with it is the drip tray.

I had one with the carafe plus the single serve but would not accommodate k-cups. I finally decided that I needed one that would take them so that when I had company, I could serve people whatever their preference was. I generally drink decaf coffee so don't want to keep a bunch of caffeinated coffee around to go bad when I rarely use it. I bought one of the fanciest Keurig machines and absolutely hated it. It had a stainless steel carafe that would not keep the coffee hot. What is the point of having to microwave my coffee to re-warm it? Also, with anything larger than an 8 oz. cup, the coffee would come out weak and flavorless. My thought is that because the Keurig is so fast, the coffee runs through it too quickly to get much flavor out of the grounds. I packed up my Keurig and gave it to the Goodwill. I decided to try this machine. I figured that instead of making an entire pot of coffee for myself on a Sunday morning, I would just make a couple of cups, either with a k-cup or with my own grounds. I love the Hamilton Beach machines. They make terrific coffee and it comes out piping hot. One of the main things I love is that you can make a 14 oz. travel mug of coffee with their grounds attachment. That is what I always used with my previous machine. This machine is particularly nice because it also has a water reservoir on the back so you don't have to pour water into the unit with each cup.

I am used to hitting the brew button and having coffee coming out into my cup in seconds. This one pumps in the water, heats it up (and I will add, much hotter than I am used to, which is good!) then dispenses it into the cup. It waits till all of the water is at temp, before dispensing it. The coffee (and I prefer a bolder taste to my coffee) using the regular setting is good, the bold setting is perfection.

I mention our level of experience in case you think that we did something wrong. NO, we did everything the same way we did with the previous machine. Same procedure, same coffee, etc. NOTE: We don't use pre-filled coffee pods, instead we use the brown brew basket option where you put your own coffee in. (My guess is that you probably won't have a problem if you use pre-filled pods.) We knew to allow plenty of time for the brew basket to finish dripping. When the dripping appeared done we removed our mug and lifted the lid to remove the brew basket. That's when suddenly a sizable stream of coffee still came pouring out. In pic#1 you can see how much came out AFTER I made my 10oz cup. In pic #2 you can see that quite a bit still dripped out after it was removed. It wasn't a one-time event. I thought my husband must have done something wrong or didn't give enough time to the process so I made a cup for myself and stood watch over the process. Sure enough, the same thing happened. I'm so disappointed because the old unit performed so well although not long enough in my opinion. That's why we even purchased a 4 year protection coverage for this new unit. I'll be returning this unit.","Size: 40 oz., 3 Brewing Options  Color: Black",true,false,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WVr9v3QeL.jpg
