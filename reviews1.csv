R2BOEUK8YC88ST," Super hot cup of coffee!",Chad Davis,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHZVFNXUIJ625MTAHC2EWFR2MYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,"March 4, 2023","If you like hot coffee, this is the unit for you. I am astounded how hot a cup of coffee this thing makes. I usually enjoy a splash of creamer in my coffee and even after pouring cold creamer in my cup, the coffee is still quite hot.

This unit has settings for 6, 8 or 10oz brews. I find that I don't get quite that full amount in my cup. This could be caused by the retention of liquid in the k-cup itself. However, I do get a consistent amount of coffee for each brew volume selected. I enjoy getting a 14oz cup of coffee from my darker roast k-cups. The nice thing about this unit is that I can select an 8oz cup and let it brew. Then once complete I can cycle the power and then select a 6oz brew to get my 14oz cup. What is nice is that I don't have to lift the lid on the k-cup itself between the two brew cycles.

The 50oz reservoir is easy to fill. I like that I don't have to remove the tank from the unit to fill it. Simply removing the lid allows for the tank to be easily filled. I am using distilled water in my unit because my water is moderately hard. Harder water can destroy the boiler and supply lines in devices like this very quickly. So, if your water is even somewhat hard, I would suggest using distilled or bottled drinking water to ensure the longevity of your unit. The coffee maker almost immediately starts dispensing coffee once you hit the brew button. Then entire brew time takes about 1 to 2 minutes depending on the brew volume selected.

One thing to be aware of with this unit is that there is a size limitation to the cup that can be used. Tall travel mugs will not fit under this unit at all. You will have to brew into a standard size cup and transfer it to your travel mug. Additionally, if you have large diameter cups, they might not fit under the unit very well. I have some pretty large diameter cups, but only the largest of the large wouldn't fit under the unit.

Because this unit makes such a hot cup of coffee, it billows out a large amount of steam when brewing. This steam travels up the control panel and condenses a bit. I was initially worried that this steam condensation might cause problems with the control panel. However, after two months, I haven't had any issues.

Besides k-cups, you can also brew your own ground coffee in the included k-cup adapter. This is a nice feature and works quite well. The only drawback to using the k-cup adapter is cleaning it out. Even after dumping most of the grounds in the trash, you are going to have to rinse some grounds down the drain cleaning the adapter out.

Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase of the Mecity Coffee Maker. I think if you are looking to get a k-cup compatible machine, you should give the Mecity some serious consideration.",true,false,

You may get one that's not a lemon but I got a lemon and it won't make lemonade or coffee. Update after a couple days of review. Further studies determine I wasn't actually contacting seller. It was some auto response. The seller has since then reached out to me and has made this right. Whether the product is good is still to be determined but the customer service is excellent.

Pros:
- it’s fast.
- compact footprint
- comes with extra inserts for tea & coffee that others sell extra
- it makes 3 sizes of brew from 200 ml to 300 ml
- it’s cheap, but has good fit & finish
- can be descaled with vinegar (if you have hard water)

Cons:
- some parts are not dishwasher safe
- no temperature settings (for us snobs that like superhot water for brewing)
- water tank looks like it’s styrene, so DONT drop it!
- it’s made in China, so wash the <censored> outta it before use.

So far I am happy with it.

Did I say it brews fast?

UPDATE: 6 Mar 22- still going strong, did a pre-emptive descale (SWMBO tossed the box 📦 with the instructions) so I just ran a tank of water with a cup of vinegar through the unit and another tank of rinse water (tip- save the vinegar mix and add it to your dishwasher’s rinse cycle) … I suggest you descale the machine every couple of months —don’t wait for the flashing lights — if your dishwasher gets that calcium scale buildup it’s a sign your waters hard (high mineral content) and the same thing is happening inside your coffee machine.

It still brews fast…",true,false,

Let me say, after using it every day since then, that it is just perfect for a single person. I make 2 cups of coffee every day, at least. I usually use the largest cup setting, which is 12 oz! I have read reviews that they don't have a cup that fits into the space it should go. That is a little bit different than a Kurig. It's not true that a regular sized coffe cup doesn't fit there. However, a thermos type cup will not work. This taller cup I have is the only one that works on the largest cup setting. The medium cup setting dispenses about 9 oz. The smallest cup setting dispenses a little more than 7 oz. The coffee is hot at 168 degrees. It comes with a holder for single kurig type pods but it also takes pods which have an indentation in the middle of the bottom if the pods. The piercing needle is on the side instead if the middle. It comes with a super holder for tea leaves and 2 holders for you own ground coffee. I found the coffee was not strong enough for my liking using my own grounds, even dark roast. Perhaps I'd like that feature using ground coffee in the tea leaf holder as it's mych deeper. Anyway, I am loving it. If you're a single person like me, I found trying to make a pot of coffee with just enough so I didn't waste it AND it didn't taste burnt by the time I was ready for my second cup just a total pain in the a**.

Let me tell you, it makes a damn good cup of coffee with those K-cups, but when it comes to using ground coffee, it's like trying to drink battery acid. It's like they put a warning label on it, ""WARNING: May cause taste buds to fall off."" But, that's not to say it's a complete failure. It's a 3-in-1 machine, it's like having a swiss army knife of coffee makers. You can make a K-cup coffee, loose tea, and even ground coffee. But if you're gonna use ground coffee, I suggest you bring a damn fire extinguisher, because it's gonna be hot and bitter. But overall, It's not a complete disaster, it's like trying to run a marathon in flip flops, it's not ideal but you can still finish it. I'll give it 4 stars, but use it with caution. D.

Our main goal was to save money and reduce the number of k-cups we were sending to the landfill. We love that there are three different filters (pods, ground coffee or tea), giving us lots of flexibility.

Some pros so far:
** The unit is fairly compact and attractive
** Easy to operate
** Coffee is hotter than our old keurig

Some cons:
** So far we have found the coffee brewed from grounds to be weak
** The ground coffee filter is too small to add more coffee (holds 2 TbS)
** If you want a stronger cup of coffee, you’ll need to choose the 6 oz. Size

I contacted the manufacturer for tips on how to brew a stronger cup of coffee. They did reply quickly and said we should use a coarse ground, don’t tamp down the grounds and brew 6 ounces.

We are still experimenting to get a stronger cup of coffee. Will try coarsely grinding our own beans or switching to another brand of ground coffee. Will come back and update my review if we succeed.",true,false,

It is much quieter and quicker and the water is hotter and comes out instantly.

very disappointed, i notice like 4 different companies in china sell the same item with different names and none offer replacement parts, shame that a piece breaks and you have to just buy the whole new unit 79 dollars with 20 dollar coupon still is wasting a machine for a water tank replacement.
SO i guess if something breaks there motto is tough, buy another whole machine, someone into climate change might want to say something since we now have to manufacture and buy a whole other item and this one goes in the trash seems very wasteful. perhaps keurig is the better brand alittle more expensive but at least they have parts.",true,false,

I also love that there is a water reservoir. It comes ready for a k cup and there are also 2 separate cups; 1 for loose coffee grounds and the other for tea which are both labeled. Also included is a small coffee scoop with a brush on the end of the handle. I presume that the scoop fits the amount of grounds for a standard cup of coffee, so that’s nice. The buttons are few and simple. Power, full cuppa, half cuppa and barely a cuppa. Here’s the best part, this machine heats the water SO FAST! I pushed for a full cuppa and I swear it was done in a minute, maybe less. Also, the space for your cup is tall - not quite tall enough for a 20oz tumbler, but taller than a lot of the other k cup machines I’ve tried. The coffee comes out piping hot and tasty.

Excellent cup of coffee. However, the reusable tea and coffee pods are lacking. We tried using the reusable coffee pod and the results were really bad.

So, we tried the reusable pod labelled for tea and that actually let the water mix with the coffee grounds better... still not a great cup of coffee (a little weak, but far better than the pod labelled coffee). Not sure what's up with that, but if you try the coffee pod and only get vaguely brown water, try the pod labelled for tea.

So, for actual K-cup style single-use pods, this unit works great and heats to a good temperature.

However, I still keep the box in case I have to return as I do not believe in the quality of the product. This coffee maker is compact and has a sleek design. However, the quality is below subpar (see pictures):
The coffee tray is silver-coated plastic, and it already shows scratches from simply putting coffee cups on and off. The water reservoir lid is loosely snapped to the water reservoir unit and is so thin that it makes it hard to grab to remove the lid to fill up the water. Unfortunately, I accidentally dropped the lid, and it now has a dent. The three filters that come with it are also of poor quality plastic. Looking at the pictures, you will see that the filter lids have some dents and scratches and are not entirely snapped to the filter body; and that is how they come right out of the box.

So, in summary, the coffee maker works (for now) and is affordable, but most of the parts are made of low-quality plastic with low-quality control, so one may question how long it will last and whether it is safe to use.
