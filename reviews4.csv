R31RJHF8XKQ37H," A decidedly better product",AndrewBL,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFM7KSHURGTQP7YOO6KGX6G62FFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,"April 12, 2023","This Ninja Coffee Bar dual brew unit replaced an older Ninja Coffee bar I had for about 4-5 years. The older unit was always problematic. The amount of water it used for a cup or pot always varied, and the orange time to clean light eventually always stayed on and never off. Since we had soft water in our home the problem of calcium buildup was really not a problem, but the light came on nevertheless.

This new dual brew system works, so far, perfectly. It seems that Ninja has worked out the glitches. There is no more after drip when the coffee brews. The amount of water used is perfect each time I brew. (I don't use the coffee basket much, mostly the K-cup insert with reusable stainless steel K-cups with a paper filter.) We have had the unit about 4 months now and it is working perfectly. While I don't particularly like coffee brewed with soft water, purchasing bottled water gets too pricey. Still, the coffee is generally flavorful and the cleaning light hasn't yet come on once (I assume because the unit doesn't have a build-up). If you are looking for a coffee maker that can brew both K-cups (6 to 11 oz cup), and with the K-cup unit removed (using the basket) travel mugs, and from 1/2 to a full carafe of coffee (comes with a glass carafe), you have a brewing unit that pretty-much does it all. Highly recommend. Oh, and fits under our kitchen cabinet and I can raise the K-cup lid without moving the unit.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",true,false,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61v5X+T5zkL.jpg

R37UB070SDSME0," Best of both worlds!",Deb S,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF2PZDAMLK4BEB2BCSZFTRJHD7UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,"February 25, 2023","After having to replace my latest Keurig for the 5th time in 3 years (thankfully all under warranty), I began looking for something more reliable. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. Keurig has a wonderful warranty replacement policy, but 5 times in 3 years on a $200 machine?

Ninja, of course, was at the top of my list for consideration. I have several other Ninja products that I love and have had no problems with. When I found this DualBrew, I felt it would be a great choice. My husband and I drink different blends of coffee in the morning, so k-cups work well as we can each have our favorite. In the evening, though, we both drink decaf as an after dinner treat. A pot of decaf is perfect for this and much less expensive than k-cups. If we have guests, making a large pot of coffee is also more cost and time effective.

The Ninja DualBrew, like all Ninja products we own, seems well made and is sleek and slim, taking up only a small footprint of counter space. It is tall, though, as it accommodates a large travel mug in K-cup mode, so be sure to measure if you have low hanging cabinets over the counter. The removable 60 oz water reservoir makes filling and cleaning a breeze.

In k-cup mode, 3 needles on top, instead of the usual one, ensure the coffee inside the pods gets thoroughly saturated for a better tasting brew. My previous Keurig did have 5 needles, but this Ninja was right on par taste wise. There is also a ‚Äúrich‚Äù setting for a slightly stronger brew and an ‚Äúover ice‚Äù setting as well as the classic brew that works in either k-cup or pot mode. A dial on the front allows you to choose the amount of coffee to be dispensed. The max setting for k-cups is 12 oz, but if your travel mug is larger like mine, I run the machine twice on the 8 oz setting using the same k-cup set on ‚Äúrich‚Äù. This is perfect for me, but if you want an even stronger brew you could use a new k-cup for the second brew. Coffee made in either k-cup or pot mode comes out steaming hot. Pot mode also automatically triggers a keep warm feature to keep your coffee ready to drink for up to 4 hours.

Switching between k-cups and pot is very easy. You just insert or remove the k-cup cartridge. For a pot of coffee, this Ninja uses regular #4 cone filters.

I‚Äôve only had my DualBrew for 2 months, so I can‚Äôt yet speak to longevity, but so far I‚Äôm loving it. I will update this review if anything changes.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",true,false,,,
R3O3P6GV6X377Z," Fantastic Machine",Amazon Customer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFTI33GMLES6J6RVOFTOXIORBIMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,"March 16, 2023","I have been patiently awaiting arrival of this coffee maker. It‚Äôs a bit soon to report on all of the great features. I bought this to supplement an inexpensive Keurig K-Essentials single cup coffee maker that I already had replaced under warranty.
I read the directions and went through the setup just fine. I was most interested in trying the single k-cup feature. I purchased the Aieve reusable k-cup that accepts ground coffee and it worked great. Someone also makes single disposable paper filters that fit into the reusable filter to further prevent grounds. I think that was a common complaint.
I will most likely never make a pot of coffee since I am by myself but it‚Äôs nice to have it.
I didn‚Äôt bother with setting the clock or any of that. I don‚Äôt plan to leave it plugged in.
My only concern was that the warming plate stayed on for a long time while I tried the single cup feature and could imagine getting accidentally burned. I couldn‚Äôt get it to turn off.
I think it‚Äôs a great looking machine and has fantastic, easy to use features.

Made a few iced coffees. I am hooked. A little milk, a few packets of sugar and a hazelnut non dairy creamer added in. Wonderful üëç","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",true,false,,,

I got it to replace my old Keurig coffee maker. I like the fact that when I use the baskets for a single cup, I can run the coffee through the #4 filter as well as the screened basket. We use to get lots of grounds with the Keurig and it was annoying. This unit makes very nice coffee. There is one catch. When making one cup at a time the number of ounces listed on the machine is no where near accurate. We have 12 Oz. cups and when you tell it to make 12 Oz. of coffee, it males about 8 Oz. I experimented and finally came up with setting it for 8 Oz. and pushing the button a second time after it makes the first 7 Oz. then you have to stop it before it runs your cup over because you get a total of about 14 Oz. It seems to work fine when you make a 12 cup pot of coffee and I have not tried to make a large 30 Oz. batch yet.

I originally ordered the Kuerig brew 2+ but NEVER got it delivered so I filled out for an Amazon refund. I really would have liked the Kuerig because it had a metal thermal carafe & did pods. I was AFRAID to order the same carafe because the company never delivered it.
I found this Ninja that does both a carafe or pods, it was less expensive and the coffee maker uses less space on the counter. The only difference is it does not have a metal thermal coffee carafe just glass. The Ninja does have a warming plate that you can manually turn off or on and figured that would keep the coffee warm and made up for NOT having the thermal metal carafe. I just received the Ninja 200 series & love the look of it, easy to read front panel. I ran a pot of water through as instructed before using. First think I made a cup of coffee using the pod section and it worked perfectly.
So far so good, hopefully...... I'm a little skeptical because this is the 3rd coffee maker I've gotten since Late November. 1) The first we got at Best Buy and returned the next day because it leaked water everywhere.
2) was the Kuerig I ordered from Amazon early Jan and never got it by Feb 1 so requested refund & got it
3) I ordered the Ninja on Feb 1 and had it at my front door later the next day on Feb 2.
One compliment I'd like to add is Amazon's refund service. I requested the refund on the Kuerig and an emailed refund confirmation was in my mailbox in minutes.

Update:
The more I use this Ninja coffee maker the more I really like it. The coffee makes good tasting coffee and love how the different pods work.

It took me about an hour to dislodge the piece of what I think was a hunk of coffee that was not ground small enough. So if your pot all of a sudden stopped making pods, starts blowing up pods, starts shooting grounds everywhere use a tooth pick or bread tie wire and clean out that tube. I love this coffee pot.

McMillan,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFPQFQGEUGF546EEF37LFM7HIZ6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4,"October 5, 2022","Let me get the bad out first.. You're going to have to experiment and come up with a recipe based on this coffee makers' concept of ""ounces"".
It's listed as a ""12-cup coffeemaker"", but there are no 'cups' anywhere indicated... just presets in seemingly arbitrary ounces... with pictures of vessels you may have, but I don't.
Since 1 scoop = 6 ounces, you'd think it'd be in 6's. Nope. It's 7, 12, 18, 26, 37, 47, etc. weird.
Then there is classic vs. rich, which supposedly reduces the ounces.
At '41' ounces, mine brewed 48 ounces of water. I measured after brewing. Then I thought, well, no grounds, so let me try again with grounds.
This time I made '37' ounces on 'classic'. I got a little over 40, much closer. I still don't understand why they bother with a very specific and arbitrary number, then deliver a different amount. That irks me still.

(On a sidenote, I bought a 'binroc' grinder that had a different set of numbers/cups that was also adding to the morning math challenge. It stopped grinding properly after a month so that went back. Now I'm grinding with a simple and reliable Capresso again.)

All that said, once I figured out how much coffee it actually produced, I could then go back and figure out how many scoops to use. I now know ""41 rich = 8 scoops"" and ""37 classic = 6 scoops"" etc..

Figuring out the k-cup is a lot easier... it's just like any other. You have a fixed amount of coffee in your pod... so, more for weaker, less for stronger.

I'm not nuts about having to store the k-cup part. It doesn't really fit on top or around it easily. I knew that going in. It's a small price to pay for the option I guess. You could just as easily buy another small kcup machine that has the same footprint. So to me, this is a little bit of a gimmick unless you rarely use k-cups and have a place for the converter.

The flip-down mug holder is great, useful, and sturdy.

The pot pours a wider stream than I'm used to, but doesn't leak or dribble. I like the pouring quality. I'm not crazy about how the lid unscrews/screws in. Kind of hard to align.

I love having a reservoir instead of a pot for the source water. I think it makes the water cleaner. (psychologically) It's also convenient if you just want a little bit and old coffee is still in the pot.

The brew quality is good. I haven't noticed a significant degradation or improvement from the Hamilton Beach or pour-overs that I've tried. I can tell when beans are fresh, when they're too fine/course, etc. So in that regard, it brews well. Also, I haven't had too many grinds in my carafe... If I did, it was likely me doing something wrong.

So overall, it makes a very good cup of coffee, is easy to use (once you get it dialed-in). I like the versatility, style, and compact footprint. I never wanted to return it. It was worth figuring it out and making it work. I've had it a month or so now and will keep it until it dies.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",true,false,,,

RU80HKPHLYTBL," good combo for pods and grounds",josh redd,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG4OFTUSEGMSGT2GCTRRXQZAZQMQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,"January 14, 2022","I bought this because, while I like to make pour overs and such, I also like to have an instant option for K cups. You can see my old Keurig in the back. But then I also like to have a full pot option for guests or to wake up with the smell of coffee on the weekends. But I‚Äôm not putting ALL of that on my counter so I needed a solution like this Ninja DualBrew.

It was very intuitive. In fact, I didn‚Äôt even need to read the instructions to figure out how things worked or how to even get the Pod adapter out for a full carafe. The machine won‚Äôt even let you use the carafe settings (high volume of water) unless the pod adapter is removed and the brewing shower head is slid forward over the basket. So you don‚Äôt need to worry about accidentally brewing half a gallon of water into an 8 oz cup. I tried to brew my first pod cup but it let me know it needed cleaning and upon checking the quick start guide, it let me know that the Ninja needs to run a full carafe brew (only with water, no coffee) before it‚Äôs ready to be used. I did that first and then it worked. It‚Äôs nice to have a water reservoir too, as you can see my previous Keurig machine was an older simpler version that did not have a reservoir feature. There is also a coffee scoop on the left side that fits into the body of the machine and comes off and on easy.

There are multiple brew modes including classic, rich, and over ice, each brewing differently. There is a flip down cup stand for smaller cups to reduce splatter. While a lot of Mr. Coffee machines have a spring loaded closing valve to stop the flow of coffee if you pull the carafe out mid-way, the Ninja features a manual lever that slides left to right just under the main screen. At first, I though this was a shortcoming and wondered what would happen if I forgot to flip it over and the water started overflowing in the basket. But after reading the guide, I found that the machine will stop actively brewing while it is closed and after a short period of time, if you do not flip it back, it will beep to let you know. If you don‚Äôt flip it back after five minutes, it will cancel the brew altogether. So it actually ends up being a great feature and safer than forgetting it and letting the basket overflow. The hotplate also has a light up warning to let you know it‚Äôs warm and the ninja adjusts the heat depending on the size of the brew and how long it will stay on the plate to avoid burning the coffee.

All in all, lot‚Äôs of cool features, some physical, some in the software that runs it. Intuitive to use and feels like a quality machine from a quality brand.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",true,false,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610+U2Ymj6L.jpg,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610+U2Ymj6L.jpg,

K-cup and would have grounds in my cup something awful. Did a little research and found that if I pressed the k-cup down firmly along the edges it would settle better in place when I would float the lid and do not have coffee grounds. I was happy they worked because if not I was shipping it back. There are 3 needles that puncture the top but only one hole to filter coffee through so I don‚Äôt think it punctures the bottom big enough to allow the water going in to go out as fast this causing the K-cup to overflow. By pushing the cup down firmly first it seems to have eliminated that issue. It also may depend on the brand of ‚Äúk-cup‚Äù you use.

As far as the rest‚Ä¶.LOVE IT. I have a smaller model than this in our RV. For whatever reason I seem to like the coffee flowing to the bottom through their little cyclone tunnel thing. Probably just me. It probably serves no real purpose. LOL

I kinda dislike the the lever to shut off the drip feature if you want a cup NOW! I do understand it though. It quits pouring water into the coffee filter so you don‚Äôt have a pool of coffee sitting in the grounds. Just takes a little getting use to.

The water coming out is H-O-T! It will burn your lips and tongue. That is remarkable. Our Keurig did not produce that hot of coffee.

The reason we bought this was because,
1) we like ‚ÄúK-Cups‚Äù
2) But for the work days we need/REALLY like programming our pot.
3) We like the Ninja name brand.
4) I LOVE the side water reservoir. I don‚Äôt have to fill the machine EVERY time for coffee.

We bought the Keurig Duo for $40 around Black Friday 2021 from Walmart, BUT was disappointed with the lack of programming. We also have a Hamilton Beach coffee maker tower(?) the coffee is made and sits in a carafe on a heating plate and you push a button for a cup of coffee (think like a fountain pop/soda). And we liked that one, but it doesn‚Äôt do k-cups and I was tired of two different machines taking up space.

I would recommend and would buy another if need be.

The only issue is the 6oz setting does not produce a very hot cup of coffee (and hasn‚Äôt from the start). We have to microwave it to get it hot enough. 8oz and over is just fine.

I finally gave up on Keurig, after several defective brewers. I went in search of a single serve brewer that produced a hot, strong (flavor) cup of coffee using a k-cup.

Initial impressions: Used it the first time this morning. It has three brew needles, which provides better extraction and a stronger cup of coffee. I use Starbucks French Roast k-cups and the 8oz setting with ‚ÄúRich‚Äù mode. This combination produces a nice strong, flavorful cup of coffee. It‚Äôs even stronger using the 6oz size. The temperature of a 6oz cup is over 15 degrees cooler than that of an 8oz cup (which is why it did not get 5 stars). Temperature control would be a nice feature.

I love that the pod adapter can be removed from the machine for easy cleaning. Tomorrow I will try the paper filter and my own grounds to see how that turns out.

First thing I love about this pot is the coffee is actually HOT. The last two pots I‚Äôve gotten over the last 10+ years, most recently a Braun and before that a Keurig, only made the coffee hot enough to drink black, right then. Otherwise I had reheat in the microwave. This machine makes it scalding hot, as the coffee gods intended. It wasn‚Äôt as straightforward to set up as other machines, but the booklet was clearly written and once set up, it‚Äôs easy to use. It‚Äôs also FAST. It makes a carafe in about the same time as our last machine made 20oz. Finally, it‚Äôs a small touch, but having the scoop stored in the side is so convenient. I cannot speak to the pod brewing part, as we will not be using it. I have a culinary friend who warned me off of ‚Äúanything made by Ninja‚Äù but he was clearly wrong on this one. As long as it holds up mechanically, I‚Äôd have to say this is pretty perfect for an electric brewer.

The Ninja CFP201 DualBrew System has been another game changer. I was able to downsize my coffee pot and my K Cup machine into one. I kept both just incase it some how was a fail; but quickly donated them after a week.

1st it came with everything you needed to get started and make a couple pots of coffee! I do love that about the Ninja they don't make you have to run around trying to get the disposables.

Instructions are clear for both use and cleaning. But really both are straight forward I don't think you'll really need them.

Tea Drinkers! I drink a lot of loose leaf tea (I like to blend my own) and the reusable K cups work great. I also tried tea bags both in the reusable cup and without and both worked well too. Usually I just run water through my machine and have the bag in the cup. At least we know it works well all 3 ways.

Coffee Drinkers! It works as expected; Normal Kcups (any brand) and reusable K cups (I tried 3 different brands). Non got stuck or had to be giggled into place. I don't like that an un named brand has changed it up that only their reusable cups work in their machines well so the fact that Ninja isn't trying to control what you buy; I like a lot.

Originally bought this Ninja just for its k-cup brew functionality as a replacement for our Keurig that crapped out after we finished its first descale mode. The Keurig just wouldn't turn back on into brew mode.

Frankly we are happy we got this Ninja Dual Brew as it's ridiculously super bad ass. It's like a transformer toy for a coffee lover. Multiple Pieces fit together to support each brew method. Its pretty cool. In order to brew a regular pot of coffee you lift up on a lever, pull up and remove the k-cup tray that reveals the basket port for regular coffee brewing. Then you pull on another tab for the water drip head that is conveniently hidden inside the back of the machine to come forward over the brew basket.
The rich brew feature takes the flavor of the k-cup to a whole nuther level. Tastes full-bodied, like a Nespresso Vertuo.
We've had a Ninja Coffee specialty coffee maker for over 5 years and it's still holding strong so we feel this unit will be very reliable. Each section of the coffee maker has replacement parts available on the ninjakitchen.com website.
Definitely recommend this coffee maker. It's a well thought-out contraption.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",true,false,,,

I always have figured Kcups were a much inferior taste producer. The Ninja offered the single-use or a chance to have a second cup without the inconvenience of reloading the coffee and water (also no need for a second maker when you have company)..I was cautiously optimistic about brewing small amounts with fresh grinds (you sometimes have to scoop way too many tbsp of grounds), but much to my surprise the 8-12oz cups have all been robust (using the measure cup estimates). The classic setting with the max scoop recomm has suited my taste, well. Even the Kcup has been pleasingly good (hot chocolate, included) with 8oz on ""classic"". And, lastly, I have trialed the carafe (even on timer) with great results, and the warmer keeps the brew an ample amount hot...it is an investment at this price, so I purchased the 4yr extended warranty - well worth it considering I have, once again, regained my coffee satisfaction...","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",true,false,,,

I should have just upgraded to the actual Keurig brand with the same options, but I second guessed myself and went with this POS. I am two steps away from ordering a new Keurig, but having paid $150 for this horrible Ninja brewer, I am fighting with myself to NOT spend another $150+ on another one. I just wish the company would listen to my issue vs. telling me its not them.
Also, the 'support' line was going to make me pay for the replacement part ($60) even though there is a one year warranty on this product. I had to question them on this and they finally made an exception for me to ship it for free. But again, who knows when that will happen.
If you can, I'd say STAY AWAY from this product and buy the Keurig one - they have some really great bundle sales on their website now too.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",true,false,,,

So I'm not going to write a big, angry review. This is just a data point for people buying this product.

But yeah... my Ninja broke after a few months. I wasn't doing anything unusual with it - just brewing 4-6 kcups/day. There was a new squeaky noise emitting from its plumbing one day. And it flashed the message indicating it needed cleaning. I ran two clean cycles following instructions, but the device remained stuck in a mode where it always recommended cleaning and would not brew kcups. (There is a separate mode for brewing full pots that continues to work.)

I'm not interested in getting repairs or replacements under warranty, because I value my time in dealing with this and any future maintenance. I'm just switching to a different brand to see if somebody else has a more reliable design/manufacturing process.

If the device didn't break down on me, my review would be like this:
* it generally does everything it claims to do reasonably well
* there is a separate part that houses the kcup which looks easily replaceable. As the mechanical operations around puncturing the kcup seem most likely to break, I like that I can replace this part without buying a whole new machine.
* the device won't work with most (any?) reusable kcups because it punctures into the kcup via 3 ""fangs"" rather than the typical 1 that punctures the center of the kcup.
* the UI (buttons, screen, lights) is a little cluttered and occasionally confusing. I spent one morning troubleshooting to figure out that I'd accidentally closed a valve. Maybe too many options?
* the water sensor often complains that more water is needed incorrectly, but you can ignore that warning and hit the brew button again
* the beeps that the device makes are loud, and I wish that I could turn them off. Particularly, the ""all done"" beeps. It happens that in my house, the device is near a couch that someone is often sleeping on.

I wish the Ninja had worked out for me. I might have just had bad luck, but there are a few hints of low engineering quality. I wish Amazon would provide metrics around long-term product failures so that we don't have to rely on anecdotal evidence like mine.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",true,false,,,

Machine takes minimal counter space, brews the perfect temp, is easy to clean and needs a water refill every other day based off our usage. Very minimal grounds are in our coffee, if at all. I like the feature that turns the water drip off a lot, too.

Just beware, I thought there would be a frother, but not on this model. Also, I can't move the water container and move it to the back on this model. I don't want either of those options, but if you do, you need to look into a different model or something.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",true,false,,,

This morning after 5 months of daily use, it broke. The switch to stop the coffee flow (to sneak a cup) broke. It snapped and springs went flying. We can't make it run any coffee now because it displays an error about closing the switch. This coffee maker cost way too much for all these issues.

I called tech support and she said I needed a new base and said she would need to charge me $25 for shipping. I explained that I have never even used this machine yet and would not pay shipping for a product that doesn't work that is brand new. She talked to her manager and was able to send me a new coffee maker. Great! I was ready to test this out again. This time set up was fine. Brewing coffee in the coffee maker worked well but using kcups no matter what we tried the majority of the time a large amount of coffee grounds ended up in our cup.

After a few days of using it, my wife complained that it never gets the coffee hot enough. She uses a little milk (not a lot), so I thought it may be that. She tried it black this morning and said it was better, but I thought I'd test it out. On the 10oz rich setting (full cup) of single-serve brewing, the initial water coming out (didn't even use a filter or grounds which would cool it down more) was 155F. The water never got about 165F coming out of the brewer. Not sure how it's supposed to brew decent coffee at that temperature. Even with a warmed mug, there's no way the coffee can be fully extracted if the water going through it isn't hot enough. Not sure if we have a defective unit or if Ninja just didn't design it to heat up enough for a single-serve.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",true,false,,,

Wow, what a great coffee maker. Everything about this brewer is superior to all the other brewers I've owned. It appears to be a solid and well constructed product with a large water reservoir. The controls are intuitive, making brewing a breeze as well as setting the clock after a power loss.

It quickly brews a very good cup of coffee using pods, even better than the Keurig K-Supreme (this is subjective on my part as I haven't tried a side-by-side test). If I really want to indulge myself, I set the brew to ""Rich"". A big disappointment with the K-Supreme was that it claimed to accept tall travel mugs. However, my Takeya Traveler 17 ounce mug would not fit in the Keurig, but fits easily with the Ninja.

The Ninja is able to brew ground coffee and comes with a carafe. Between the Ninja and my French Press, I have the trifecta of coffee goodness and able to choose the brewing method based on the amount of time I have at the moment. The only thing that would make this brewer even better would be illuminated buttons to make it easier to find the on/off button.

I have absolutely loved this brewer in the months that I've had it and am optimistic that it will last longer than the other brewers I've owned.

Being able to have one coffee maker which will brew a full pot or K-cup is quite nice but the K-cup side is a bit sketchy. It leaves an inordinate amount of coffee grounds in every cup brewed, something I had not experienced with the Kurig I had previously. I have found using a filter in the grounds holder used for making a full pot will trap the grounds from a K-cup however not all the coffee drains through if used for more than one cup. Again not a big deal but still something I should not need to do. So, if you buy this coffee maker be prepared to drink coffee grounds or toss out the last few sips of each cup or waste coffee filters unnecessarily.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",false,false,,,

Some days, I want a pod, and other days, I want to to use my own coffee grinds. I also didn't know how much I would love the different styles and the ability to make 1/2 a carafe instead of 2 individual cups. I usually set my coffee to ""rich"" and the taste is amazing. I tested the same coffee grind in my other machine, and also a drip hand pour and the Ninja is by far the best. Also, unlike other machines, the coffee is hot, not lukewarm which is very common in other machines. I sometimes use the frother, and it's incredibility easy to use and clean (unlike the Nespresso jug that you cannot put in your dish washer or even let soak). The only compliant and it's not a real one is that this machine takes a lot longer to make a cup. Probably the longest of any machine I've had. It really brews your cup in optimal settings.

R2B7RYYQGZJXWT," Perfect for anyplace where versatility is important",UCA Lady,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJOS7HNSO3SU7OY77Z3XURDIEIQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4,"October 3, 2021","I received both this version of the new Ninja Coffeemaker and the more expensive version that also makes hot water and has a frother. Due to a problem with the more expensive version, this was the one where I was actually able to see the concept in action. To be frank, unless you are very pressed for counter space, I think I'd choose this version. If I wanted clean hot water and frothy milk in addition to many versions of coffee, I'd have a separate frother that would also heat the milk, and one of the wonderful new induction kettles that are available for modest prices for any hot water I needed.

So, the downsides of this version of the Ninja Coffeemaker are that you are forced to have the water container on the side and can't move it to the back to save counter space. You don't have a separate hot water button, so you either have to have a separate kettle for absolutely clean hot water, or it will flow through the coffee section and might pick up a few stray coffee grounds. And, you won't be able to froth milk with the same machine as you use to make your coffee.

On the plus side, besides the money you'll save, the rest of the device works exactly the same as the more expensive one, and also, the choices you have are always present and readable on the face of the coffeemaker. Since I don't use pods, I took that part of the machine off and easily slid the section forward that holds the coffee grounds. There is a handy measuring spoon with guides for the amount of grounds to use for different drink sizes. It's easy to fold down the device that holds your cup rather than use the large carafe. If you want to have absolutely fresh grounds to use, you will need a separate grinder, but you can get quite good ones that are small and not terribly expensive if you are a purist! And, you will need to have a supply of paper cone inserts on hand.

After that, it's simple. Fill the water to the top mark. I like the fact that it's much easier to fill from a pitcher without spilling water all over the place as I always tended to do with old Mr. Coffee. The machine will only use the amount of water necessary to make the drink you choose, so you don't need to be exact -- just fill it up! Choose the brew you want. Specialty drink recipes will make very strong coffee that can be diluted with flavorings, and the ""rich"" selection will also make stronger coffee when you use a lot of milk. These choices mean that you might think this coffee is as good as you would get from a French Press or even an expresso maker. One thing I want to try is the iced coffee choice. You will actually get cold coffee over ice -- not hot coffee that will melt half your ice and dilute the coffee!

I found it very simple to choose not only the brew I wanted, classic for a smooth non-acidic drink or rich to use with a lot of milk in my case. By choosing the size of container, I could get a small or large cupful, or part of a pot. And of course, for several coffee drinkers or to fill a thermos, I could choose an entire pot of coffee. It took a very short time for the machine to heat up and start making coffee. To pour a cup in the middle of the process, you just turn off the drip -- an ""extra"" that is also available on this less expensive version -- pour out a cup of coffee, and then turn the drip back on to continue with the rest of the pot.

So, unless I didn't have space for a separate frother that would also heat my milk, or no separate way to get hot water for tea or hot chocolate, I think I would skip the more expensive version and go with this otherwise identical machine. It should keep everyone happy in the office break room, or in the home of several coffee drinkers who have different preferences of how they like they morning Joe.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",false,true,,,

It was shipped carefully inside of its cardboard product box, with the machine surrounded by ""eggshell"" carton. It came with everything that is pictured here, as well as a quick start manual and a more thorough instruction booklet. Getting started is easy, and I was immediately able to figure out how to brew a K-cup pod right away. I think that the features of the machine are really well designed and help make it user friendly, as well as beginner friendly if you're new to coffee makers with pods. I love that you have the option of easily switching between both methods of ground coffee or pods by taking out or inserting the K-cup adapter. The design of the machine is really well thought out to take up the least amount of space. I have very limited counter space so I wasn't sure I'd be able to keep this machine permanently out, but once I saw how little space it takes up compared to a Keurig machine with similar features, I knew this one would permanently stay out. In terms of the quality of the brew, I'd say it is just as good, if not better than the Keurig. I get very minimal residual grounds in my coffee cup, as well as in the machine. It warms up very quickly, and I love the options between sizes, brew strengths, and over ice. I could go on about all its features, but really everything that's on this page works just as promised. My only very minor gripe was that I had a hard time figuring out how to set the time, but that's probably just me. You cannot set the hour and minute separately, like you can on other machines and appliances. You have to scroll through the entire clock to get to the exact hour and time. So for example, if you're at 9:00 A.M. and want to get to 8:00 P.M., you must scroll through every minute of every hour until you get to the P.M. hours. I hope that made sense. Anyway, with that being said, I love this machine and would definitely consider purchasing one if I ever need another.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",false,true,,,

The Ninja CPF201 lives up to its promises ‚Äì It makes hot or cold coffee, it does this quickly, and it gives personal options, including a wide variety of sizes.

The cord is 30‚Äù from the machine to the prongs, giving it a sufficient length. I was not thrilled to see the cord originating from the back left side, since my outlet is on the right, but it reached the outlet easily.

I was impressed with the packaging‚Äîall parts were protected in plastic and the carafe was protected in its own cardboard box.

As with any new appliance, I recommend reading the guide first. Initially, I found it difficult to remove the lid from the carafe, but with a little more effort, it twisted out. The carafe has a nice wrap-around handle attached to the glass and the handle itself is large and allows for a good grip on the carafe, so you won‚Äôt drop it.

When you plug the machine in, you must set the clock. Follow the guide and this setup is easy. The clock allows you to set a delayed brew to your desired time.

For the first ‚Äúpriming‚Äù brew with the carafe, it is again important to use the guide to ensure that you remove the pod adapter and slide the lid forward. This sliding mechanism is unusual, but it contains the steam. Familiarize yourself with the coffee maker parts and the rest is a breeze. The dashes on the front of the coffee maker light up left to right as the carafe fills. No matter how much you brew, it flashes all the way over and then beeps. As the brew occurred, light steam exited the top. It is obvious the coffee is hot as it is brewing. The brewing time for 28 ounces was only about 3 minutes. A smart feature is the Drip Stop. If you‚Äôre in a hurry for your first cup of brewed coffee, you can manually switch the drip to ‚Äúclosed‚Äù, pour the coffee, then open it again to finish.

The Ninja owner‚Äôs guide is important for the pod adapter. It can be tricky with the Remove and Lock positions. Follow the instructions and you can easily brew 8 ounces of coffee in less than a minute! One of the nice features to the pod brewing is that there are three large pins that punch the pod. The coffee was well brewed because the Ninja pauses and restarts the water flow to maximize the flavor. The cup platform for single-serve has a rubber grid to prevent your coffee cup from slipping, another plus in the design.

For Over Ice coffee, I was very pleased to learn that this can be done with ground or pod coffee. I used a pod. The coffee was strong, and the drip process barely melted the ice.

Overall, I am very pleased with Ninja Dual Brew Coffee Maker and see no flaws in the design. I like that it requires more vertical than horizontal space, and I can make coffee for one, for five, or for ten people all from the same source!","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",false,true,,,

Chewy had grown very fond of the K-cup feature, (particularly using hot chocolate cups, sold separately) which he enjoyed when Han was busy working on the Lipation Overdrive Modules, or trying to seduce one of the three breasted wild women from the planet Nurgins 12.

First off if you‚Äôre using K-Cups, you have options of 6,8,9, and 11, I find that having the precision ounces instead of me sloppily pouring water in helps with the taste of my coffee. Next the brew style of Classic, Rich or Over ice is definitely useful. I‚Äôve found myself using the Rich style over Classic, as I felt the Classic gave my coffee more of a burned taste. But if that‚Äôs to your liking you that option. Also, when you have guests and need the larger pot of coffee, having the carafe is awesome. Lastly the feature I knew I never needed till I had it, is the timer. OMG this saves me so much time in the morning. I set it at night, and on time the next day. Another thing that‚Äôs great is it starts brewing and pouring almost right away, and I honestly haven‚Äôt seen that in any other machine I‚Äôve owned. Overall, this is such a great machine, just wish it was slightly smaller.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",false,true,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81+NmP9A0+L.jpg

R1ATD88E2QAHR5," Brings Out the Flavor of Coffee/K-Cups; Can be Calibrated for Temperature",Amanda D,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF42C7Q3JVLKUYBZI5GOCV5MALTA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,"September 26, 2021","This Ninja DualBrew Coffee System eliminates the need for several machines; it can used for hot water, three brewing styles and either K-Cup or filtered coffee. This coffee machine has a brew style option (classic, rich or over ice), a hot water function, a programmable clock, drip stop indicators, a ""keep warm"" function, ""smart sensing"", an additional measuring cup, attached to the side of the machine, a calibration brew to determine the heat setting for your altitude and the ability to brew K-cups or filtered coffee. It arrives well packaged; it is easy to unbox and the manual makes it straightforward to begin using.

Upon arrival and depending on your altitude, you will need to calibrate the machine. This process is extremely straightforward and will allow for a more enjoyable brewing experience as it prevents excess steaming from the machine when in use. You will then have to run a cleaning brew with a full pot of water. I found this to be useful as it also introduces you to how the machine works. You can then program the clock and your machine is ready for use.

The K-cup or filtered pot of coffee option is very straightforward to use. You can remove the K-cup insert and the coffee filter area is ready to be loaded. First, use one of the filters provided in the package and then place your coffee grounds. This option allows for the possibility of grinding your own coffee but also is useful for a full pot instead of using several K-cups. Once your coffee is loaded, you simply pull the handle on the hidden cover forward and then begin the cycle. There is a heating pad below the coffee pot to keep the coffee warmed. If you want a K-cup, you make sure the K-cup insert is locked in place and then insert your K-cup as you normally would. Pull down the attachment for your coffee cup to be higher in place. Click the setting for the ounces you require and then run the cycle as per the brew setting appropriate to the K-Cup.

This coffee machine has been the best coffee machine that I have had to date. I have previously owned single cups, K-cups and full pot coffee systems, and none of them have incorporated all the best features into one machine like this one does. The coffee flavor is phenomenal and the machine itself is very easy to use. Not only does this machine come with a very thorough manual but it also arrives with a Quick Start Guide for those who do not want to flip through the manual in its entirety right at the beginning of receiving it. This coffee machine is by far the highest quality coffee machine I've used to date; I highly recommend it.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",false,true,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41uw3b41xIL.jpg

I find it to be excellent in both.

The coffee carafe passes one of the two ""pour tests."" The first is when pouring coffee, does it run down the side of the carafe. I am happy to report it does not. No drips on the counter top! The second pour test is whether or not you can pour out the last drop easily. Unfortunately, the answer is no. The is a small amount of coffee always left at the bottom of the pot.

There's no apparent water filter in this system, which is something it is missing.

It accepts #4 coffee filters (the triangle shaped kind), and comes with some in the box.

If you have a small sink, it will be difficult to fill the water container. It is tall. You may have to pour water in it from the pot or a beaker.

The only thing I can really complain about is that I have nowhere to put the Keurig pod adapter when its not in use. It would be great if it was somehow built-in and retractable for when you want to use the coffee pot.

Overall, this is an excellent coffee system. Even my wife's grandparents want one now.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",false,true,,,

They‚Äôve probably used bunn coffee makers for over 30 years and as soon as theirs is going bad they buy a brand new one. We also have a keurig and with that and the bunn it‚Äôs just taking up a lot of counter space. I saw this and thought it would be perfect to help get rid of both and have a machine that‚Äôs all-in-one. It‚Äôs still going to take some convincing to get my parents to let us get rid of the bunn but right now I am really impressed with this machine! It is a little overwhelming when you first take it out and see al the different parts and pieces that you can adjust, but once you read the quick start guide it‚Äôs simple to get the hang of.

I love that it doesn‚Äôt take up a whole bunch of space everything is pretty compact. It has like 10 different size options to make from a cup to a whole 12 cup carafe and you can make in between sizes like 1/2 a cup or 3/4 of a carafe and all the in betweens.

It has 3 different brewing options - Classic - rich - and over ice. We‚Äôve used the classic and the over ice so far. I don‚Äôt understand how the over ice works but it‚Äôs like magic. You fill your cup with ice and when the coffee is done brewing over it - it‚Äôs cold. The ice doesn‚Äôt melt much and the coffee is ice cold! It‚Äôs magic and it‚Äôs great. I‚Äôm stepping up my at home ice coffee game in the most simple way.

Two fun things it has is a spot for the cup measured on the side so you don‚Äôt lose it, and a piece that folds down under the brewer so you can set a cup or tumbler on it.

It‚Äôs really easy to change the machine from ground to kcup with the adapter. The default is to use kcups and you just lift up on the adapter. If you want to use grounds you just pull the adapter and take it out and then there is the piece for the grounds underneath. You slide the metal cover to go over the grounds and you‚Äôre all set.

The buttons are easy to use, you click the brew type, turn the dial to the size and click the button and you‚Äôre good to go. The water carafe on the side has measurements so you know how much to add. I‚Äôm just really impressed with the simplicity and the slight things that I wouldn‚Äôt have though of like the piece to slide to close or open the drip hole.

I‚Äôve always loved ninja but this coffee pot is a home run for me.

The clever design allows you to remove the Kuerig unit and slide the top over a container of coffee so you can brew up to 55 oz in the pot. The coffee comes out super hot, and so far we have had excellent coffee, but there's an issue. When using the coffee maker to make a pot of coffee, it has a small basket and if you load in the recommended amount of grounds, you will get some in your coffee. I've found that the max I can put in is right around 4 scoops from the included measuring tool.

The basket does double duty because it holds the Keurig device. If you leave the basket off by accident, you can expect a huge mess, because coffee will splatter.

When making a pot of coffee, there is no automatic shut off on the basket either. You can slide a switch to the side so the coffee stops if you can't wait for the coffee to finish brewing.

I like this coffee maker, and it makes great coffee. My one concern is that I had a Ninja coffee maker a 5 years ago, and it only lasted for 2 years. Right after the warranty expired, it began to leak water internally, which made a huge mess.

However, it only made enough for a small cup, not the large mug I liked. It worked well enough. When we first saw a Ninja coffee maker (years ago!), we got one. Not only could I make a cup, mug, or pot, I could use ""Rich"" mode to make it stronger. However I made one mistake, I got the one with the carafe, not the glass pot. It lacked the warming plate that the one that comes with the glass pot has and the carafe cooled down a little too quick for me. I saw this model a few weeks ago and tried to pass it up (our original Ninja still worked as good as the day we bought it). It not only offered new features including the ability to use K Cups, but I could get the glass pot with the warmer. It got ordered!

Typical of all the Ninja products we've bought, it's a quality product. It's easy to use... I only needed to consult the manual to see how to remove the K Cup adapter and how much coffee to use. Setup is straight forward... take the packing meterials away and run some water through it to rinse it before you use it the first time (it's in the manual). This took only a few minutes and I was brewing my first mug of coffee.

It brews fast and the amount selection LEDs display the progress when brewing (nice touch). Speaking of amounts, you can brew a cup, large cup, travel mug, large travel mug, half pot, and full pot. You get Classic, Rich, and Over Ice modes to select from. Rich is a stronger version of Classic. The warming plate only comes on when set to one of the pot modes and by default is on for 2 hours. You can change that for up to 4 hours of on time. You can also turn it off if you're done early by pressing the warming button. There is a red LED on the warming plate that lets you know when it's hot.

Typical of all of the Ninja products (and we've have many), this is a well thought out and executed design. I highly recommend it!","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",false,true,,,

But the old one had some electrical issue over time where it caused my lights to flicker in my dining room when it was on. So I got this one to replace it. Even though this one is a stripped down/simpler version, I love it!

Pros:

It makes a really good tasting cup of coffee.

The design is really sleek/good looking. My old one had a lot more of the stainless steel/less of the black surface and it looked smudged a lot. This one stays looking cleaner.

The size options! This has so many different size options, way more than the last one I owned, which is really nice. I love that it shows you both the cup size (travel mug, large mug, half carafe) as well as the actual ounces for each option.

The iced coffee is awesome. I love having a coffee maker that can also do iced coffee from the machine and you don't have to wait around for it to cool. Just fill your cup with ice, brew the coffee with the over ice setting, and you have a really nice cup of iced coffee.

Comes with a coffee grounds scoop that conveniently attaches to the side - love this for space saving and reducing clutter.

Cons:

I wish it came with a metal/reusable coffee ground filter like my old one did, but I've been using Size #4 paper filters and it works just fine.

I don't like using K Cup pods because I think they are pretty bad for the environment and don't taste as good as the local brand coffee grounds I get. But I can see how that would be nice for others. And it might be convenient having some so I can offer a variety of options for guests who visit.

I wish this one also had the milk frother built into the side like my old one did. I think the next model up from this one had that. It's just nice because that would also reduce clutter.

There is NO built in coffee grinder. The Review Model is CFP-201, 3 Brew Styles, 12 Cup with Glass Carafe. ASIN-B08QZXFSKP

Brew Style Choices include: Select Classic, Rich or Over Ice or K- Cup coffee pods.

To brew a K-Cup an adapter insert slips into the top of the filter location. The normal filter cover recedes into the top of the coffee maker. A shelf folds from the rear for a cup position. The adapter will accommodate several pod sizes. And the amount can be regulated with front panel control.

Brewing ground coffee requires grinding with a separate device or using commercial ground coffee. There is no internal coffee grinder. I use a Burr Grinder which we feel gives the best result. In the Classic large carafe size the warmer maintains temperature without coffee deterioration. No burned taste was detected as the coffee neared the bottom of the pot.

Ninja provides a side mounted water reservoir that can be removed for filling. It can be filled on the side of the coffee maker by removing the top cover. On the front are markings from cup to carafe size. On the Coffeemaker front panel the amount of coffee can be selected. As the coffee brews an indicator panel shows how much coffee has finished.

When first plugged into AC POWER the clock must be set. There is NO back up battery. If the coffee maker is unplugged or power is lost the clock has to be re-set. One feature I have not seen on a coffee maker is the calibration of boiling water point for high altitude. Once this has been set at initial set-up it will retain until a recalibration is performed. The added benefit of saving kitchen counter space with the combination of two functions in one device is great for us. My wife drinks K-Cup Decaf and I prefer regular ground coffee.

I love this machine - Ninja CFP201, it‚Äôs super easy to use, has great features, great coffee, but I so miss the extras - at least four - that the upgraded CFP301 model gives for just $30 more (as of this review). This machine offers K-Cup delivery or a regular 12-cup coffee pot brew (or traveler amounts in between) and it‚Äôs super easy to switch between the two. There are controls for the amount of brew and strength. Options include classic, rich or over ice. There is a pull down mug tray to help with smaller portions. The coffee brews very quickly, and there is a switch to pause if I can‚Äôt wait to pour my first cup.

Now for what is missing, the fun extras - four of them‚Ä¶and my source of envy. The upgraded pot CFP301 has a built-in frother that can fold out from from the pot, so easy to use and right there (only drawback is that it doesn‚Äôt heat, but it can handle hot liquids from the microwave). It also has a specialty brew function to create up to 4 oz. of a more concentrated coffee meant for the specialty coffees with froth and syrup adds - it‚Äôs a slow-timed brew with a varying water flow cycle. Also on the upgraded model is a hot water option (hot and boil). This water line is separate from the coffee, good for a quick cup of tea, hot chocolate, instant soup, etc. Also, the water reservoir can be repositioned on this model if there are counter space issues.

Ninja has really nailed the design on this machine (and it‚Äôs upgraded model). These machines use temperature variation, a varied water cycle, and a shower head dispense for an advanced coffee brew. The machine is so easy to use, so intuitive. There‚Äôs a quick start guide, along with a more comprehensive owner‚Äôs guide. I suggest watching YouTube for tutorials and tips.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",false,true,,,

I‚Äôll state the bad up front. First the carafe is fragile glass and sits on a heated burner. If you like cooked, burnt coffee this is great. But, if you like fresh, smooth coffee, move on. This machine gives you two choices, turn the burner off and have Luke warm coffee or learn to like it cooked. Next, the computer does not give you infinite water brew selections. This leaves you guessing as to how much coffee you use and it requires fiddling to select the ‚Äúright‚Äù amount of water. Then there‚Äôs the fragility of the carafe. Do not let it touch the side of your sink or it just may shatter. It‚Äôs way to thin. Finally, the machine is overly complicated. All of those electronics are just waiting to fail. I am sorry we have this machine. I‚Äôm going back to my French press and leaving to my wife.

This Ninja CFP201 DualBrew coffee maker puts 3 holes in each cup. So that allows more of the coffee to be extracted, this improving the flavor. But the latest Keurig K-Supreme coffee makers actually put 4 holes in each cup, so they do the best job at extracting the most flavor from each K-Cup. But this Ninja is close. I was surprised at how good my coffee tasted when I used it. This is the first non-Keurig brand coffee maker that I have used that is as good as most Keurig brand ones when using K-Cups. But you also have the ability to brew regular ground coffee instead if you choose. When I made a pot of coffee using the ground coffee I typically drink, the flavor was just as good as my Braun drip coffee maker. Another nice feature of this machine is that it can dispense hot water through a separate spout, so the water doesn't taste like coffee. That is a very handy feature if you want to make some tea or hot chocolate. If you want the ability to use both ground coffee and K-Cups and you have limited space, this machine is perfect. The quality is better than I expected and it's well worth the price in my opinion.","Color: Black  Size: 12 Cup<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style: 3 Brew Styles",false,true,,,

You tell it how big your cup is, tell it that it is iced, and press the button. It will brew especially for your cup full of ice. It makes the perfect iced coffee.

The coffee maker is perfect, every time. It is easy to use, and doesn't take up a bunch of space. I love it, and I highly recommend spending the money on it.

To start, the materials are thick and the finish is nice and has a premium feel to it.

Setup is simple. Remove the tape and other packaging materials, fill the water tank, and run a full regular cycle to prime. That‚Äôs it! The maker comes with the K-Cup adapter pre-installed. The lid slides back and forth to lock in place or release for removal. When removed, a cover slides forward for making regular drip coffee. All of this is well labelled with removable stickers and provides a very user-friendly experience.

And, most important, this coffee maker does a great job at making coffee. I‚Äôve brewed both a regular carafe and used K-Cups. The coffee is brewed almost immediately, comes out without splashing (may vary based on the cup used), and doesn‚Äôt pick up any flavors from the coffee maker.

My previous keurig coffee maker made by the actual company produced fairly watered down coffee when making 10oz cups. I just accepted this is how it is due to the small amount of coffee in the keurig cups. Well now that I have this coffee maker I see that's not really true! The Nija makes excellent coffee even when used with keurig cups and making fairly large cups of coffee.

It turned out to be the best decision I made in small appliances in recent years. It makes an outstanding cup of coffee, and if you're a coffee lover like me, that is the first crucial step in getting your day off to a good start. It appears to be high quality and there are some thoughtful features, with the removable water reservoir being near the top. The glass carafe is also much thicker than your typical glass carafes from other brands. It seems like it will take the occasional impact much better, and not shatter in your hand should you accidentally tap the side of your countertop, for example.

The are two very minor issues with the unit. First, your typical metal cone filter will work, but you will need to gently squeeze/bend it to fit. If you want to use a metal filter and want one that just drops in and fits perfectly, you will need to purchase one from Ninja. This was slightly disappointing given the fact that only their filter fits 100%., and you meed to spend an additional $15.

The other nit pick is with the way the volume is referenced. This unit doesn't use the typical number of cups as is used by just about every other coffee maker out there. Instead, they use ounces. While it should be easy for most to do the simple math knowing that a cup is 8oz (most coffee makers actually count 6oz as a cup of coffee), it is something you will have to get accustomed to. Again, not an issue that should deter you, just have to adjust to.
