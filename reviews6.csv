I'm not even a big fan of the thing. We got it at work to replace our old knockoff Keurig because it started dripping nonstop after it already finished brewing. It does it too, just not as badly. You can see the remnants of it's coffee splatters in my photo. It's a daily chore to wipe everything down after every use. It drips so bad you would think it has an enlarged prostate. It dribbles like the 2004 Suns featuring a young Steve Nash. It splatters like an ice cream cake falling out of your clumsy uncle's touchy hands during your horrible childhood birthday party.

With that said, it works as a coffee maker. You clean it every month or so with vinegar or a cleaning k-cup. It is what it is. So I can't believe I have to defend this barely passable thing from the couple people complaining about not being able to choose your cup size. You add the water and it brews what you add. You want less, add less, add more, and you get more. The things borderline crap but you can't fault it for your own incompetence. What's next? People are gonna say, ""My new Camry is crap! I crashed when I tried steering with my feet. One star! Curse you Toyota!""

the maximum amount it holds is 14 oz, but loses close to an ounce in evaporation. you add the amount you want to adjust for stronger or weaker brew with more, or less, water.

this news either choice very quickly, under 2 minutes max so far. I can fill it, brew it while reading my cat & it's then ready to go.

You have to add water for every use which isn't a big deal but it's inconvenient but it also takes about 5 minutes just to heat up and start making one cup and it pours until either the water runs out or you turn it off yourself. It doesn't have an automatic stop pour so you basically have to stand right next to it the whole time and also the plastic on the machine itself gets very hot and you can even smell a burning plastic smell when it's going.

This is not the fault of this machine, just to be clear. It’s just that you won’t get high-quality coffee with these types of machines. I get a way better cup of coffee using my stovetop Moka Pot than I can get with these types of machines. However, for ease of use and convenience, this machine works well.

I love that you can use both ground coffee and K-Cup pods with this machine. The water capacity is from 6-14oz. I was using 6oz water and the maximum amount of ground coffee (there’s a line in the container that tells you the maximum amount of ground coffee you can fill in it) to make my cup. I felt my coffee was quite weak and watery, even with using the lowest amount of water, but I don’t think it’s the fault of this machine. I think I’m used to coffee from my Moka Pot which makes thick, rich coffee.

For milk, I got the best results from frothing milk before adding to the coffee or using a creamer. Here’s a tip. If you don’t have a milk frother, you can add a bit of warm milk to a French Press and pump it up and down a few times. You’ll have frothy milk in no time.

This machine gets a good score from me for its easy cleaning process, ease of use, convenience, and quick coffee-making time. It’s lightweight and small so it doesn’t take up much space. It’s slightly on the pricier side, especially when other branded machines are similarly priced.

I cannot really fault it much but I don’t find myself reaching for this when I need a cup of coffee. This is, of course, a personal preference. My Moka Pot gets used way more than this machine.",Color: Green with Travel Cup,false,true,
R1RKREY0TTX902," Too flimsy and top heavy for my situation, and single-serve proved to be frustrating",Jeannette Belliveau,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFLLV3ULYDN5ESYELAGS7726NA5A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,3,"October 28, 2021","This might be a decent choice for someone who is very careful to not knock over things and willing to deal with a lightweight, somewhat vertical and top-heavy appliance oriented to single serving. For me, I was looking to use this Kingdoo coffee maker on a jobsite in a building where the electric install is not complete, meaning that it was on a table plugged into an adapter on the floor. In no time at all, on the first morning I set it up, its cord had been had been kicked and it was on the floor with the fragile hinge to the water compartment broken.

In fairness to the product, it is not specifically designed to be rugged, but I was concerned that even in a regular kitchen plugged into a wall outlet, it would be very easy for anyone moving quickly to knock this over while loading water or dealing with the attachments needed to insert K cups or coffee. Also, the hinge was a bit tricky to operate from the get-go.

Also if you are used to a brand-name coffee maker using capsules or pods, this coffee maker may be a bit baffling to you given its lack of width at the base, which the brand-name models have to provide stability. Also be aware that as mentioned in the. name, this is a single-serve appliance , which means it may not be the best choice for any group setting (job site, office, etc.) because you have to load it with water for each use.

I have had a pod machine from another brand just like this for over 5 years, so I was excited to get this pretty green version to replace my old one. However, it has failed so miserably I have had to go back to my old machine.

First, the safety switch that the lid should hold down to let the machine work, fails. It is like the lid pops up slightly as it heats up. Then, if you risk burning yourself by holding down the lid, something in the thermal sensor also fails, so it boils very hard for several minutes... Shooting and dribbling out the back until finally it sputters less than half the water through to your cup.

To make matters worse, I tried to contact the company by the card it included in its box with no response. Then I tried contacting through Amazon, and they still haven't responded over a week later.

My k-cup coffee machine was the best seller of Amazon at the time and it took very long time to make the coffee. However, this coffee maker comes out much faster. It only took about 1 minute so it is very short.

The regular coffee machines cannot make a single serving coffee. Instead, it makes a big pot of coffee. Since this coffee machine could make coffee between 6 oz and 14 oz once, I could make one cup for myself or two for my wife as well. Because we do not drink more than that per day, we do not need to worry about wasting our coffee.

Even though it is versatile (can make k-cup and ground coffee), the coffee machine itself has a small size; thus, it could fit on my crowded counter top easily. Also I chose the black color and it matches with my stainless steel kitchen appliances well.

I also used the milk frother occasionally to make a latte. It can make foam very well and I could put it on the top of my coffee like regular coffee baristas do. That makes the coffee creamer.",Color: Black with Milk Frother,true,false,

This machine is so tiny but it can beat the any other similar machines in the market. You can either put the single Serb K- cups or a coffee packs in to the machine. In each serving we can fill 8.0z of coffee (either in a coffee mug or a travel mug) they both fit perfect to fill with the machine.

The body and the style makes the machine more good looking and strong. The travel cup that comes with this machine is so good and fits perfect in any car holder. Easy to carry and easy to clean.",,true,false,
