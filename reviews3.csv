RV6WK9SWBWCVH," Perfect Single Cup Coffee Maker - Excellent for those who grind their own beans!",Mark A Moore,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHAULFOHPPXFZWREDVCEQYSZ4ABQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,"April 25, 2023","I got the Instant Solo Single Serve Coffee Maker a day ago. I've always had Keurig machines and used the My K-cup reusable pod. I purchased this maker when my old Keurig died. I was looking for a more affordable option that would last longer than the Keurig machines that rarely last more than 3 years. After reading the reviews for the Instant Solo, I decided to give it a try. My first impressions are as follows:
1. The machine is well made and well designed. I really like the light touch buttons.
2. Cleaning the machine and getting to the various components is easy.
3. I really like the reusable coffee pod that comes with the coffee maker. Please note that other generic reusable coffee pods won't fit this unit.
4. The taste of the coffee I made with the reusable pod was far superior to the coffee brewed using the Keurig machine - I think that is because the brew cycle is a bit slower and the grounds are hit with a bit of water to prep the coffee before the brewing starts.
5. The first brew which was a brew with fresh water after unboxing was a bit of a chore as the machine kept erroring out. I figured it was due to the fact that the water pump was dry and needed to be primed. I just unplugged the machine and repeated pressing the brew cycle a couple of times and eventually the coffee maker started working. Also, there will be a bit of a plastic smell the first time the coffee maker is used. That smell goes away completely after the initial run through with fresh water. I ran a plain water cycle 5 or 6 times to make sure the machine was completely flushed out.

As far as durability goes we are in the early days but so far I am very happy with purchase.",Color: Black,true,false,

I've had 3 Keurigs and was not pleased with them, so that brand was out. I wasn't sure about Solo but it was reasonably priced and had good reviews. Now, after almost 3 weeks of using it, I can say I made a very good choice.
This single serve brewer takes up far less space on my countertop. Although I wish it came in a stainless steel finish, it's attractive in black.
Operation is simple. Tap the power icon, tap your cup size (8, 10, or 12 ounces), and you're done. There is a bold option you can also tap where the brew is longer to extract more flavor. I haven't used that yet because I'm pleased with the strength of the coffee without it.
The cup brews quickly. There's maybe a 10 second wait time before coffee begins flowing into the cup. The machine is quiet, and when I remove the k cup it is not drippy. Most importantly, my coffee is hot and the flavor is excellent.
Cleaning is easy. I haven't had to run a cleaning cycle yet, but cleaning the exterior is a breeze. Far fewer cracks and crevices where the coffee splashes gather. My Cuisinart splashed a lot. I was constantly wiping the unit behind where the cup sits and thought it was normal. This unit hardly splashes at all.
The water reservoir holds 42 ounces and I thought I'd be filling it all the time. My old unit held 72 ounces. Yes, I have to fill the Solo reservoir more often, but not where it's a bother and I realize that my water is fresher.
Finally, the top on the reservoir is round. No big deal, right? Well, it is a big deal, surprisingly. When I was in a hurry with my old unit, if I didn't put the top on just right, it would drop into the water reservoir and I'd have to fish it out. It happened pretty often and it was irritating. The reservoir top on the Solo does not and cannot fall into the reservoir because it is round. Such a little thing, but so very nice.
Now that I have experienced the Solo, even if I had money to purchase a more expensive brand, I would still pick the Solo. I am well pleased with it and highly recommend it. The Instant Pot people have another winning appliance!",Color: Black,true,false,

I also keep these type of water units on bar mats to capture any overflow so, was prepared during the initial startup test. I replaced our Hamilton Beach Flex Brew single-serve matching units, we wanted something smaller with reservoirs for the coffee bar. These do brew a very hot cup of coffee. I have previously owned many Keurigs units they used to be my preferred gifts and I bought one for the office. My first Keurig was great, the subsequent units were not reliable so and given the price, I no longer purchase those.

I visited my daughter at Christmas and she had a little Keurig. I noticed she had used a larger one but it died. I told her to get the Instant coffee maker and kuerig was a bad one now.

I was convinced it was the best way to get a good, rich cup of coffee. I don't know why, but one morning I decided I was tired of heating up water for just one cup of coffee.

I did a lot of searching on Amazon and other retailers comparing features and prices of small coffee makers. I am very happy with my decision to buy the Instant Solo Single Serve Coffee Maker, (from the Makers of Instant Pot.)

It has a very simple and straight forward design, it's easy to clean, and the cord isn't annoyingly short. It has a slim profile so it doesn't take up a lot of space on the kitchen counter. The water reservoir is an ample size and is on the back of the unit, not on the side. (Which is one reason that I chose this coffee maker.)

The Instant solo makes a great cup and takes half the counter space. I like the bold setting button too.
Only problem is that excess water collects in the pod section. At times coffee starts to drip then stops and makes a whooshing sound as steam spews out. Restarting works but dump the original out or the cup runs over. Water also drips out after removing the pod.

After many years of using ""THE"" name in pod coffee makers, I got tired of the same product failures over and over. The water reservoirs for the Keurig always fail after a couple of years of use. Since a replacement reservoir is $35, it was a no brainer to try the Instanthome single use coffee maker (on sale for $60).
As usual item came on time and in good shape from Amazon. Set up was a breeze. After the usual clean up and flush of the unit, I made the first cup of coffee. Results were excellent - good strong brew had just what I expected in terms of flavor, etc. Coffee seems a bit hotter than from the Keurig AND brewed a bit faster than from my Keurig Supreme.
DOWNSIDE: An other example of a manufacturer that places their ease of manufacture ABOVE the customer's ease of use. In order to register the unit you have to enter a long registration number AND DATE code.
The information is on the BASE of the unit. Probably easier when the line produces goods to put it there BUT it is NOT anyplace else in the item. NOT on the box, or manual or whatever.
Once the unit is set up to my liking, I am annoyed by having to remove the water tank and flip the unit over to get the information.
All they had to do was ADD a line in the manual - ""PLEASE, BEFORE set up, CHECK the registration number and product date ON THE BASE OF THE UNIT"". Since there are 3 pages of disclaimers, IT would NOT be difficult to add ONE line in BOLD face type to the manual. Older people have trouble with holding such things steady, and writing down a long string of numbers at the same time. I hope that the unit lasts at least as long as my several Keurig's - bought over too many years. I am surprised that a CANADIAN based company did not think this through.

There was a really good sale on this so I thought why not?

First thing I realized is that they have a proprietary pod. Yes, the pod design is useful as it makes sure you seat the pod the correct way. However, even if its slightly off, you'll get hot water/coffee flying out of the front. That was annoying at first but was a mistake that I def learned from.

Second thing I noticed is that the nozzle sprays a little more than the keurig models when it starts up. It's not the end of the world but I have to clear up a little more.

Other than that, its a decent machine that makes a decent cup of coffee. My only major gripe and the sole reason for reducing a star is because spare pods are impossible to find. I've been looking for a month and a half and they're either out of stock or someone is charging a kidney to sell you one.

The plus side-looks just like photo and fits well in smaller space, quick enough brew time, water reservoir holds more than my last keurig machine did so you fill less, and you can play around with coffee to water ratio as well as with coffee pods verses fresh ground coffee to reach your coffee preference. The cons, it splashes much more than my last machine did while brewing, leaving coffee splatter all over the machine, cup you're filling, wall near the machine, and coffee and sugar canisters near machine despite how you put the pod into the machine. It also has a terrible chemical smell and taste if the machine stands for more than a couple of hours without using. To combat this problem I empty the water tank and refill before every brewing session and run a cup of water only first before adding a pod to brew my coffee. I've tried running a cleaning cycle through it multiple times, but the chemical smell and taste remains to the first cup brewed after more than a couple of hours of standing without use.

This unit adds a reservoir (I never minded pouring in daily water), a bold setting (I will never use this because the regular setting with my dark Italian roast is just fantastic) and brewing in 90 secs.

The only thing I miss is being able to brew more than 12 oz in a single round. My travel and tall mugs are at least 16 oz, so that's disappointing. I can't give a 4.5 star rating, so I split the difference.

I saw a number of reviews about sputtering and overflow from the top, and sure enough, after doing the two initial cleaning runs, I scooped the provided basket full of coffee, and water bubbled over during brewing. Per physics, I guessed there wasn't enough room for both the steeping water and all of that coffee in the well for the basket. Sure enough, when I actually followed the instructions, I only added 2 Tbsp of ground coffee to the basket. That was below the first line of the basket (and I'd filled mine to the brim with coffee!). With the proper/smaller amount of coffee, the next cup was just as bold and hot, and there was no overflow of water. I haven't experienced any of the spatter others experienced with any size muges.

I really like this unit and am very glad it went on sale! It makes morning coffee fast and delicious. I already am a devout Instant Pot user, so adding this to my happiness with the Instant brand.",Color: White,true,false,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4153HbnsbTL.jpg

I have gone through two Keurigs over the last two years and neither is comparable to this machine in both quality and taste.

I ordered this machine to replace my broken Keurig as it was on special ($79; Normally $99, much cheaper than the $135 price tag in other places) and liked the quality of the Instant brand products I have purchased in the past. I assumed if I disliked it, Amazon has been great about returns in the past. Needless to say, I will not be returning this item. It is quiet and barely makes noise compared to its Keurig counterpart. I have tried both K cups and it’s included mini scoop for ground coffee, both options are spectacular. The Bold setting adds more dimensions of flavour. The touch screen responds well and is pretty quick to go from loading to brewing. It has a tiny jingle when the brewing is done, nothing too unpleasant or irritating… I rather like it myself.

If you are debating this Instant product over a Keurig, you will thank yourself for choosing this option. I have had the very coffee I brew at the coffee shop, and it was never quite there when brewed with my Keurig. However, this Instant coffee maker tasted exactly like the coffee shop version.

The sizing is about the same size as a mini Keurig but slightly smaller. The design is sleek and easy to clean, the removable tray comes off with ease. It has a removable water tank that’s easy to clean if needed. ( Holds about 40 oz)

All in all, I’m so happy I decided to go with this option and can’t wait to see how well it goes over time.

Pros:

Quick Brew
Can use K Cup or Your own Ground Coffee with included scoop pod.
Sleek design
Touch screen
Size options (8,10,12 ounces)
Bold option
Easy to remove and fill tank ( can be filled separately or whilst in the machine)

Cons:

No indication of water level. I have no issue with this as my Keurig is per cup but I understand others have different models and may not have this experience.

Overflow, I have not had this issue more than once but understand some people have. I am aware you can remove the tray if that is a problem and it lessens this a bit, but if I could be honest, I would recommend a tall and wider cup. This issue for me only presented on smaller tea cup sized mug, so I grabbed my larger coffee mug and this issue was no longer an issue. There is spray (as to empty the pod of all fluid) which can be a bit untidy but Keurig also manages to produce this result. The difference between the two is I rarely have a leaky pod once I remove it from the machine. Makes it easier to disassemble for recycling.

Possible issues with touch censor but this is nothing I have dealt with yet, but know some may prefer the mechanical option as it may be easier.

Again, this is worth a chance to be considered especially being you can return the item if you dislike it. I found the coffee from this Instant Solo is preferred by myself and my guests who use it. I say the bold option was the biggest game changer.",Color: Black,true,false,

The Instant Solo has a lot of things going for it. It’s fast! I don’t have to wait 5 minutes for my K brand coffee maker to decide whether or not it’s going to work. The Solo works instantly and that’s pretty great.

Unfortunately, the flavor just isn’t there. I have used ~4 kinds of grounds in the handy reusable pod, and ~10 varieties of K cup in the Solo. The flavors are muted, like they were brewed with far more water than they were.

While this isn’t my perfect coffee maker, it’s perfect for people in a genuine hurry. My other coffee makers can take 5+ minutes (and a power cycle!) to make a single cup. The Solo functions flawlessly and immediately.

Perfect for professionals, students, and people who really don’t want to wait for their coffee or other hot beverage.

I have to say that it was outstandingly good. Much better than my old broken Keurig Supreme Plus ever produced. Not sure how or why, but it's a remarkable difference. Maybe there really is something to their pre-infusion process. It was delicious!

I had to ding the rating because at first try to do the initial brewing/cleaning process, I would push the 8 oz button it says to push and it would make a noise and then start flashing all the lights and chirping 3 or 4 times and then do nothing. I tried several times. Turned it on/off/on. Unplugged and replugged and removed the reservoir and placed it back on a few times without any success. The last time I removed the reservoir I pushed the little plug thing a few times, not sure if that was the problem, but when I replaced the reservoir again, it finally worked when I pressed the button.

There is no troubleshooting information such as what the chirps meant or what to do. We'll see how it does for the next time.

It has two pieces, the lid and the basket. The lid has a little metal piece that needs to slide into the inside rim of the cup and then the handle locks into place. Early in the morning it is really hard to see the slot the metal piece needs to go in.

If you fill the basket to much and if the handle does not lock into place then the machine drips coffee like crazy. The water will actually drip from the end of handle as it sticks out of the machine. This is what I have to work on, not overfilling the basket and making sure the handle can lock onto the cup so the machine does not leak.

Visiting family members who love their K-Cups, and me ... who drinks dark roast decaf that doesn't come in K-Cups. And I'm not dealing with two coffee makers! My daughter was going to bring her Keurig when she came to visit, but how inconvenient is that?

Fortunately, my 12-cup coffeemaker broke - yes, that sounds weird - and I was on the search for a new one. My doctor had been advising me to cut down on my coffee intake, so a single-cup machine seemed like a good idea to break me from my 2-pot-a-day habit.

The Instant Solo Single Serve Coffee Maker was on sale and looked like it checked all my boxes when it came to requirements, except I thought I'd have to buy a smaller travel mug as the description didn't seem like it would accommodate a 20oz travel mug. I liked that it was compact, and I had a choice of colors, even though I chose basic black.

When my Solo arrived, I was surprised that my 20oz travel mug did, in fact, fit when I removed the drip tray. And, even though the machine only brews 8, 10, or 12oz, I can fill my 20oz tumbler by brewing 12oz and then 8oz (and who said my math was bad?!) My daughter can use her K-Cups without having to bring her Keurig to visit, and I can use my beloved Kirkland dark roast decaf in the supplied reusable coffee pod.

The reusable coffee pod is handy! it comes completely apart, so no hidden corners for coffee grounds to get stuck in. It's solid and well-constructed, so it can take the thumping you give it when you bang it to get the coffee grounds out, and the handle means you don't get covered in wet, sticky grounds, as well as is a means to place it correctly in the machine.

Cleaning is a breeze! The water container is straight-sided and easy to wash and dry. It's also large enough that I only have to fill it daily.

The Instant Solo offers several benefits over the Keurig—the coffee is hotter and seems less bitter (same K-cups), it has a more effective bold/strong setting, can hold more water, and it hasn’t had any issues brewing (unlike my Keurig). It also comes with a well made filter cup if you want the option of using your own coffee and it is pretty quick at making a cup of coffee, even with the bold setting. One feature that seems to be unique to this coffee maker is that it has a “pre-infuse cycle” which soaks the grounds before brewing—this may be why the coffee doesn’t taste as bitter.

The coffee maker does have a few negatives for me.
1. The cup sizes are not accurate. When I select 8 ounces (smallest cup size), I get almost 10 ounces of coffee—if you want less, you have to watch the coffee brew and press the 8 ounce button again when you want it to stop brewing, keeping in mind that it will continue to add some water after you press the button. This is the main downside for me since I prefer 7-8 ounces of coffee when I use K-cups.
2. It causes much more splatter than the Keurig. I now use a black 4”x2” mini cake pan turned upside down to raise my cup (see photos) and this has eliminated the splatter. A ramekin would also work well for this purpose. If this coffee maker is updated at some point, it would be great if the manufacturer could make the height of drip tray adjustable.
3. It doesn’t slide easily on the counter. I keep the coffee maker in an appliance garage and slide it out when I use it. I don’t want to use an appliance caddy (takes up more counter space), so I added small (1.2”) self-adhesive appliance sliders to the bottom of the coffee maker. I used 4 sliders under the main part of the coffee maker and 2 stacks of 2 sliders under the drip tray which is elevated (see photo). This hack has worked great— the coffee maker now slides easily on the counter when I need it to.

Overall, I would rate the coffee maker 4.5 out of 5 if I could, but since there are no half stars, I’m giving it 5 stars since it is a great coffee maker overall. Do keep in mind that if you want less than ~10 ounces of coffee, you will need to manually stop the brewing cycle. If this isn’t an issue for you, I do highly recommend this coffee maker.",Color: Black,true,false,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wuUVknAaL.jpg

For those that know me, I meticulously research everything before I make a purchase. I was first introduced to single serve coffee makers by our daughter just before Thanksgiving. She had a Keurig that used only k cups. It made a good cup of coffee and I was sold on the idea. So my research began. I soon discovered the major downside of using these single serve pods. They are way more expensive than just using ground coffee and the empty pods are terrible for the environment!
My research led me to this coffee maker by Instant Pot. It is a dual brew system using EITHER k cup pods OR ground coffee. I jumped in with both feet and bought a little electric coffee bean grinder for good measure. So, although I will likely not use the k cup pods in this, I can and will buy whole beans for the best and freshest cup of coffee. If we have company that likes the k pod coffee route, I can accommodate them.
All that said, I brewed my first piping hot 8 oz. cup of coffee this morning and it tasted great! The machine is very easy to use and clean.

I just hated that when it was a morning where I needed to brew and go, I had to either buy another insulated cup with a tapered lower half (to fit in my car’s cupholder) or brew in a mug and pour into one that’s travel-friendly.

Now, I just remove the drip tray and let it brew into my travel cup of choice and go!

So far so good. I’ve only used it a couple of days. If I had a ding, it would be how strong of a plastic smell it had upon unboxing and that the part that holds the k-cup/reusable cup doesn’t tilt toward you for easy removal. Mine is on a k-cup drawer thing that sits on the counter under my cabinets. I can get the kcup out but it takes a second. No big deal AND I could scoot it out and open the lid fully if it truly was a bother. I just thought I’d mention that.

What I wish was different- I have a travel mug that is 22 Oz. The machine only allows 3 cup size option to pick from. 8, 10 and 12oz, so i have to wait for the first brew to finish, and then select another cycle to fill. DO NOT fill the water reservoir other than the exact amount you want to fill for one cup. The maker will continue to run until the water is gone, flooding everywhere.

I love the reservoir for the water, enough to hold about 2-3 cups. It allows you to brew ground coffee or use KCups. And the coffee tastes great.

HOWEVER, I learned the hard way that it does not work with all KCup brands. This is likely the fault of the KCup makers, not this product. I purchased a unit and found that while it worked some of the time, when it didn't work it was a disaster. It would spit out hot coffee and grounds from the lid, all over the floor or the person in front of it. I tried every diagnostic I could think of and finally concluded that it was ONLY having this problem with a particular brand of KCup. Everything else worked fine. The brand that didn't work for me was the Meijer store brand...I think it's called Frederik's. The Starbucks brand and other brands (like Aldi coffee) worked just fine. But whenever we'd use the Meijer store brand it was a horrible mess--even dangerous to anyone standing in front of the machine.

In case you wonder if it was the machine...I returned the first one we bought and had the same problem with the new one (which we are keeping). So I'm 99% sure it's the pods, as that is the only difference.

We are trying to cut back use on our Nespresso Virtuo machine, the best coffee period but at $1.25 per cup it’s beyond our budget. Where with this machine if we buy in bulk, we can get down to around $.29 cents/ cup, which is affordable.
We like the big water tank, ( that we are used to with our Nespresso machine, was a must have). We like the ability for different cup sizes, however if using a standard size cup the coffee stream has to fall too far and makes a huge mess of our counter with drops of coffee splashing as it comes out. The Nespresso and similar machines have an adjustable cup platform, that prevents the splashing. I read a couple reviews about the splashing, (blowing them off as kooks), but they are right, the machine is very messy, especially with granite counters that stain easily, (it’s no longer allowed in the kitchen, after I stained the granite, so I moved it to my workshop with white countertops, ( now also stained).
Kinda regretting buying it now, even though it works well and makes good coffee. It is no longer allowed in our house.
Update,,, I put a can of tuna fish under the cup when running the machine, and it works perfectly, (not staining my work bench any longer). But it’s still not allowed in the house or our motorhome. And now I have to spend several hundred dollars to get the granite polishers in to resurface the granite I ruined, ( if they can save the counter top ???).

1. When using the proprietary refillable/reusable filter there is often leakage off the handle of the filter from the opening to insert pods.
2. Ecopods do not fit in the k-cup slot (they are ever slightly to big, as if you could squeeze or force them in place which I rather not do)
3. It will start to brew a cup when there is not enough water in the reservoir (it gives a low water warning if it is empty but not if it has half a brew's worth of water)
4. While the design looks nice, it is actually difficult to get the water reservoir out of you have the coffee maker sitting at the back of your counters. I have found all three of us in my household have to pull it to the front of the counter to get to the water reservoir

Or rather, TWO of the competitor’s JFat machines. Both failed, almost to the day, at 4 months 2 days. The first machine was warranty replaced. The warranty replacement failed at—you guessed it—4 months and 2 days. My JFat machine was replaced a THIRD time (in under 9 months) but I have zero faith now in that machine. In each case the unit was toast after doing the first descaling cycle. And apparently, going online, it is a very common failure. You shouldn’t have to pay close to $100 for a coffee maker that fails every 4 months!

So I took a chance and got this unit.

Update 3 months later: I revised my review to one star. Initially this unit was GREAT. But 2 months and 2 days later, it started freaking out--belching out steam from the lid, and the pump motor sounded like it was straining to climb Mt. Everest.

I had only used distilled water in this unit, and probably brewed 2-3 cups of coffee a day.

Amazon promptly replaced the unit, and I gave the warranty replacement unit a try. It lasted less than a month when it started acting weird--all the lights would start flashing at once, etc. I unplugged everything and it seemed to be okay. As a precaution, I tried to run the cleaning cycle, following the printed instructions EXACTLY. The automated cleaning cycle would NOT work. I wound up running a tank of the descaling/water solution through manually, one cup at a time. At this point the unit was under a month old! That seemed to help a tiny bit--but the next day the belching steam started, and the unit would stop brewing WAY to early--like 2 minutes to brew six ounces, when I had pressed 12 ounces.

Today, after taking 3+ minutes to get 6 ounces of coffee, I give up. TWO brand new units in three months. And this was after TWO K-Slim units going out exactly 4 months and 2 days of use.

I have whole house water softening to eliminate mineral impurities. For the last Keurig machine and both of these machines, I used pure distilled water ONLY. Still--they quit after an absurdly short period of time. I'm not brewing 25 cups of coffee a day. I'm not brewing only powdered drinks (i.e. cocoa or the espresso types) just plain old Keurig coffee cups. I clean the unit(s) regularly, and run through the little cleaning pods about every 10 days just to be sure. And ALL of them have crapped out.

I am giving the Keurig system one last chance--I'm buying one of the best units, a Cuisinart, that has better construction and a better pump system.

Keurig et.al, you need to get your acts together and engineer and construct MUCH better products and MUCH more robust pumps. Online searches show more and more people complaining--some from even 2 days ago, all saying ""this unit only lasted 1 month"" or ""after 5 months it was toast"" or ""my old machine lasted 4 years, this one barely lasted a few months.""

As they don't make them anymore, I went on a search. This coffee maker is good, but does not accept eco pods (k-cup style without the plastic cup), which was a problem as my favorite coffee is eco pod, and I refuse to use the plastic k-cups, for environmental reasons. OK, found my coffee in ground and whole bean. Whole bean is 1/2 the price of ground (?) so now I need a coffee grinder. The little grounds holder that comes with this machine works well (they say in the description that you can use it as a coffee scoop, but obviously that only works for the first cup since it will be wet for the second cup), and the coffee was great. I use a reusable pod for tea, to cut down of coffee transfer into the tea, but my reusable pod wouldn't work. I tried 3 different reusable pods, but apparently this machine will only work with it's own pod, which you can get separately for over $12, and there would be no way to tell which was for coffee and which for tea. I finally realized that I was dealing with a ""proprietary equipment"" situation, which I object to on principle. New coffee maker arrived yesterday, makes better coffee, uses my pods (which may be why it seems better), uses reusable pods, uses anything I want. My experience with the Instant Solo has made me realize that grinding my coffee is way less expensive, so I will continue doing that, but will still have the option to use my pods when I want to.

Not bad , not ideal.

Cons
1. Outputs about 2oz more than pressed ie press 8 oz, output =~10oz ,10=12 etc Solution- Size up.

2. Splashes quite a bit. Solution -use a tall mug. Wait a few secs for the last drips.

3. Temp- outputs okayish hot drink but not hot-hot (vs Keurig)

4. Bold function: nothing to rave about.

5. Reservoir- very (easily breakable) light plastic.

Annoyance:

1. Red color is maroon /burgundy like. Very (VERY) dull, almost a flat shade. Satin or semi glosss would’ve given a little pop.
Looks cheap.

Pros.
- Quick ( ~1 min for 8oz ) & Quiet.

- Small footprint.

- Opening mechanism easy & flexibly firm.

- MAJOR kudos on the reusable coffee pod included. Very little sediments on fine grinds.

- Almost cute/classy despite the color disappointment. ALMOST.

When I first came across the Instant Solo, I was excited, since it looked be the perfect replacement. While very new, early reviews on Amazon were terrific. After receiving the Instant Solo, the first thing I found was that 8 ounces is really 10, 10 ounces is really 12, and 12 ounces is 14+. Since there were no reviews stating this, I assumed that I had a defective product and returned, choosing to replace the unit and try again. Since then I have seen one review stating the cup size difference. I have now received my replacement and sure enough, for whatever reason, the cup sizes are understated. I decided to move on with using the machine and have been very pleaded with the overall performance, and especially with coffee taste, which after allowing for appropriate water, found it to be less bitter than my Keurig and overall a better cup of coffee. The only other thing I would point out for ground coffee users is that some of the third party ""reusable cups"" do not work in this machine. I have been using Solofill cups with the Keurig and due to the hinge for the top, the Instant Solo will not close with these pods inserted.

So 8oz, 10oz & 12oz are actually 10 oz, 12oz & 14oz so be sure to use bigger cups. (It don't bother me but some maybe). 2nd is taste, it does taste a little like some places coffee, which a little watery and/or light plastic taste. So, since I use the bold taste. I press lightly on the coffee grounds to compact it a little to add more. It dose make a little light mess when opening the top but i use a napkin to clean up no problem, but it help with the taste along with letting it sit a min after brewed. Other than that, it is very comparable to its competitor keurig, just cheaper.

First let me give the pros: This coffee maker is actually fantastic. It beats my Keurig and it's extremely simple to use and clean. I love the design.
The negative part: The company's non-existent, borderline tragic customer support.
My story: After just couple of weeks using it, the coffee machine started making a loud sound when making coffee. I assumed it needed cleaning, and I followed the instructions to clean it thoroughly. It didn't make a difference. Every time it would turn on, with and without pods the sound would get louder and louder until we had to stop it. Instead of going through Amazon (my mistake) I contacted the company's customer service. The link given by Amazon takes you to a web page where you enter your claim. I provided an explanation, uploaded a video of the problems and pictures. I received an automated email the next day, with a case number. Then... 3 weeks passed with no answer. We couldn't use the coffee machine without waking up the neighbors from the noise, so I called their 800 number. They, apparently, had no record of the original claim I filed online (even after providing the case# and original email). So they opened another new ticket. SAME STORY. I received another automated email with a different case number, and another 2 weeks followed. Almost 1 1/2 into the ordeal, I decided to email their customer service for a 5th time (previous attempts were unanswered) and after writing that I was going to post my experience on social media, sure enough the next day I got an email response from someone in their support group. Nasty email, badly written, accusatory. Pretty much saying that I needed to upload everything AGAIN (for the 3rd time) and that probably I was using the coffee machine without water (laughable excuse). I did that, replied to the email once again with pictures and videos. No answer back whatsoever. By that time, the return window with Amazon was closed, so I couldn't return it. I ended up throwing that paper weight to the garbage and I followed up with one last email to the company expressing my frustration. Finally, after around 2 months of my initial contact I received an email from the same support person, telling me ""he was sorry for the long time it took"" but because ""I had disposed of the coffee maker"" they couldn't replace it anymore so they kindly gave me a 20% coupon for their website.
Seriously, this is the worst experience I have ever had with any company and it's really too bad, because the coffee machine is actually amazing and when it worked, it was hands down the best product in it's category I've seen.

In the past, I've tried various ground coffee add-ons in my old B40 Keurig, but they never worked well. The coffee was too weak, even with some hacks, and they tended to leak grounds into the cup. But the Instant Pot Solo is the perfect answer. It is extremely well-designed. Both K-cups and the ground coffee holder fit in the machine without having to remove or add parts to switch between them. The ground coffee holder holds approximately 3 Tbsp of ground coffee, which is enough to make a strong cup of coffee, whether in the 8 oz, 10 oz, or 12 oz setting. The coffee ground holder has a soft and flexible plastic red lid which seals around the needle that supplies the water and also seals the coffee grounds in the holder, so there is no leakage of grounds even when the holder is filled to capacity. The coffee produced is hot. Flavor is enhanced by four nozzles in the needle that distribute the water thoroughly. Plus, the rate at which the water flows is noticeably slower than in my old K-cup machine, thus extracting more flavor. There is also a Bold button on the machine that enhances the flavor.

Typically they make a decent product. This coffee maker isn’t one of them. I don’t even know where to begin with the utter disappointment this coffee maker is. The owners manual recommends cleaning it first. That’s an understatement, as your first brewed cup of coffee will not only smell like plastic, it will taste like it too. There’s a few ways to mitigate this, like running a water / vinegar mix through the machine. After about a liter and a half of white vinegar (which is crazy for the amount which it took) the plastic taste and smell subsided a bit. I even used a fresh pod and let it sit in the machine for a few hours to absorb some of the odor. Now, let’s talk about actually brewing of coffee. This machine brews coffee in a sad, watered down state. Yes, even with the “bold” setting the coffee comes out pretty watered down. When I bought this machine my whole intent was to use the K-pod screen cup so I could use my own coffee grounds. While the screen cup for the grounds works fine, the machine has no temperature controls for the water, (understandable for its cost). The problem with this is that it has a tendency to put the water out so hot that it burns the grounds. So your going to typically end up with watered down, burnt coffee. If your looking for a home brewing coffee machine I strongly advise against this one. This is more suited for a cheap office break room or waiting area for customers.

Also even using a 12 oz cup it splashes all over the machine. The after drip is awful!
Unfortunately I waited too long, and the time to return this coffee pot to Amazon had passed. I contacted the manufacturer, and I have to say they were willing to work with me. After sending them the serial number and model number and a video of the pot dispensing the incorrect amount, they would send me a new one. However, I have decided not to do that.

I tried changing the grind of my coffee to finer, and still weak and caused the machine to give up and all the buttons flashing. It also sputters a LOT and little drips of coffee go everywhere, unless you use a super tall like 20oz mug. Oh, and the first use, there was coffee running out the front to the machine. I am curious to try it with “Dark Magic” K-Cups, as that was always my go-to coffee back years ago when I had a Keurig machine. The only way I will keep this maker is if the K-cup coffee turns out much better and I decide to forego using my own coffee anymore. I really thought with how it says it “pre-infuses” the coffee and with the “BOLD” slower option on, it would make a decent strong cup, and it failed bigtime on that front.

I cleaned, descaled, etc. Puffs of steam, very slow trickle of coffee and awful noises. I had such high hopes, and this was my last effort of single brews because I have tried them all. This one only lasted three months. Even the competition gives me a year! So sad ...

I purchased two during prime days in Black and Red, one for home and one for office. Both for personal use. For a single brew machine, overall it is fine. I like it fine. I love the appearance, the chimes it makes are cute. For a smaller machine the reservoir holds a good amount of water and it heats well and fast. All important in my world. I am very impatient and love coffee constantly.
Now the not favorite parts. I dislike the fact that my favorite ecopods (kcups) cannot be used properly in it. The holder is not wide enough and you literally have to hold the lid in order for it to brew, which probably isn't a good idea. Or the other thing I have done if I wake in a good mood or have time I cut open and dump the grounds into the provided basket. Now the provided basket for grounds could use improvement as well. I don't hate it, but I've used better from other brands.
Overall, not a bad little machine, but without the ability to use ecopods properly, I would not purchase again and now I have two ... My thought is one may go in our camper where it isn't used every day and the other packed away for a backup.

Pros-nice color and true small footprint. Nice function chimes that can be turned off.
Cons-Cheap looking. Not sleek as pictured, disjointed looking. The main problem is the water tank lid has no handle or indent making it cumbersome/painful to use for someone with arthritis or impaired dexterity. A handle on the water tank would also help.

Original review:
I've had it about 2 weeks now and I make 2-3 cups of coffee a day. It works fine. Very straightforward, seems sturdy, everything works as described. No problems whatsoever. If I absolutely had to dredge up some kind of complaint, it would be that the minimum and maximum lines on the reservoir are hard to see, but that was easy to fix. I like my coffee scalding hot, so I pre-warm the cup with hot tap water before brewing.

Edit: One month of use, usually 3-4 times a day for coffee or tea, and it's still working just fine, no problems.",Color: Black,true,false,

I contacted them and they sent me a new machine. I wanted to give it some time before I updated my original review (below) and I can say that I have been happy with the replacement. I have not experienced the needle “clogging” problem. The only remaining issue is that it will still splatter if your cup isn’t tall enough. I have fixed that by putting something on top of the cup holder that hikes my mug up closer to the spout. I hope Instant comes up with a better solution for this common complaint. I’m changing from 3 stars to four because of this remaining issue. Overall it’s doing it’s job and makes a good, hot cup of coffee! Based on their customer service support I would recommend this coffee maker- Thanks!

I love Instant Brands. I have an Instant Pot pressure cooker and it works perfectly! I needed to replace my Keurig Elite coffee maker, that after many hard working years has begun to act a little “quirky”.
I heard about Instant’s foray into the coffee maker market, and after reading reviews and seeing it on sale, I gently suggested it to my son as a Christmas gift to me. 🤗 Unfortunately, after using it for the last week, I’ve discovered a fatal flaw in the machine.
First of all, I’ve had to get creative in order to not have water sputtering all over my counter when making a cup of coffee. I added a drip tray that’s an inch high to raise the cup up a bit closer to the drip spout. This helped with the messy delivery of coffee into my chosen mug. There's an additional problem of the cup size VS the actual ounces that you get in your cup. It’s at least 2 ounces more of coffee - so if you chose 8 Oz cup you’d receive 10 Oz. This limits your size choices tremendously. You can’t use a smaller cup - it will overflow your coffee into the drip tray. That brings us to the bigger problem- this morning I put my mug onto the drip tray, and attempted to make a cup of (much needed) coffee. The machine made half a cup and then started chiming with all lights on the control panel blinking until I turned off the power. There was water in the reservoir, so I turned it back on and tried with a fresh pod. Then it made noise, sent steam out of the upper edge of the pod compartment and sputtered clear water into the cup. I researched the problem and found that the needles needed to be cleaned. It’s been one week!
This never happened with my Keurig! It requires maintenance (which I diligently did) but after months of use.
When I cleaned the needles I discovered that the needle in the underside of the lid (which pierces the top of your k-cup) has holes that run sideways- so when it plunges into the pod, the wet coffee grounds tend to stick inside, compelling you to have to clean it often! That’s not ideal.
On a positive note- it’s a nice looking machine with a tiny footprint (perfect for my art studio) and it made fairly hot coffee.
At this point I’m thinking I’m returning this machine and I hope that Instant reads these reviews and comes up with a product worthy of their brand name. From my past experience- they do have great customer service!
Thank you- I hope this review helps!

Support offered no troubleshooting or information on it and instead wanted me to look into the issue for them, provide videos and serial numbers, ect. Having gotten a replacement unit from Amazon directly I can finally see how this thing was supposed to work to begin with.

A good model isn't crazy loud, isn't spewing steam everywhere, doesn't sometimes put out only hot water, and doesn't stop brewing randomly to make beeps and flashes that aren't documented anywhere and no one knows what they mean.

After about a month with a good model I can say it isn't a bad product when it works. Many issues still stand so you're still better off using tumblers over coffee cups to avoid splashing since it isn't height adjustable, someone with a 3D printer can fix that if you know someone.

My first attempts at making a cup of my favorite Costa Rican Tarrazzu with the refillable basket resulted in a duller version of what I'm used to. Trying to pack more coffee into the basket didn't improve it and resulted in water leaking out of the top of the basket. Ground coffee swells when it absorbs water, forcing the top of the basket open which makes it leak. Make sure you leave about 1/4 inch of space at the top, no more leaks!

Boosting the flavor intensity requires a little more involvement in the brewing process. So, press ""bold"". With your cup in place press the 8 oz brew button. You'll hear it start brewing. When you hear the first drip of coffee hit your cup press the 8 oz button again (which cancels the brewing) Wait 10-20 seconds and press the 8 oz button
again, this time letting it run the full cycle. Now drink your better tasting coffee. Pre-wetting the grounds allows the coffee to ""bloom"", resulting in a better extraction.

I usually drink a 12 oz cup in the a.m. so I'll make 8 oz as above then refill the basket (or pop in another pod) and short cycle it for another 4 oz. Perfect!

It's not as complicated as it sounds, you're basically pushing the button 3 times instead of once. Hope this helps.

I love a lot of things about it.Simple to use, easy cleaning, and because I like to use my own ground coffee, it comes with a dedicated k cup to be used for that purpose.Makes a decent cup of coffee. Works way faster then my old keurig as their is no warming up period. Interface is simple and appealing; you just turn it on and hit the quantity button and essentialy it will immediatly start producing coffee after 2 or 3 seconds.It takes up minimal counter space. One great feature is when I make a cup of coffee the end result quantity no matter which option I choose is never the exact fill I want for my cup. With this machine you can,say, choose 8 ozs and if you want just a little more you start it again and when you have what youwant in your cup hit the button again as it's running and it stops immediatley- it does not need to finish a full cycle. That is a really great option.Unfortunately, as many others have noted there is a frquent varying amount of leakage at the seal between the k-cupand the top part that flips down. It is not much, and it doesn't do it every time, but it has to be wiped up and it is annoying. This is a major design flaw that I would think could be easily addressed but because of everything else I like about the unit it's not a deal breaker as my experiance is there's some issue like this with all single cups units and for all the reasons given I'm willing to overlook it.

It doesn't take up much space on the counter, yet has a reservoir that can hold water for more than one cup. I can choose a slower brew time to make bold coffee, yet the turnaround time is still quick. And it includes a well-fitting reusuable basket so that I can use my own coffee grounds for a custom cup. The only thing I don't like is how the reservoir fits into the unit (more on that later.)

I've been using a Keurig for years when either my husband or I want a single cup of coffee. It works well when only one of us is home or when just one wants, say, a cup after dinner. Or when one wants caffeine and the other, decaf. This Instant Solo uses the same platform as the original Keurig. For the most simple usage, all you need to do is fill the reservoir with water, pop in a K-cup of any brand, and select the desired cup size. For a bolder cup, you simply press that button before selecting the cup size. The machine remembers ""bold"" only until it turns off, so that's a bit of a pain compared to my Keurig, but even the regular cycle tastes as it should.

A lot of people don't like K-cups because they seem like an overuse of plastic. Plus, it takes trial and error to find a K-cup brand and style that brews the type of coffee you like. That's where the reusable basket comes in. I love that Instant has included a basket that fits perfectly inside the machine. It has a handle that makes it easy to insert and lift out. All you need to do is fill the basket with grounds, close the lid, and put it in the machine.

As mentioned above, the reservoir can be a pain. Especially since it's located in the back of the machine, it should be easier to insert and remove without having to turn the unit around. If it's not properly seated, it knocks easily off the base, even when full. (I learned this the hard way the first time I used it.) Once it clicks in place, it stays. But the lid just sits on it and can easily be knocked off when you lift the reservoir to refill. Although I've learned to seat the reservoir until it clicks, I still frequently knock off the lid. I do like that the plastic reservoir is indented in the back so that I can grip it, but that means, yet again, that I have to turn the machine around to grasp it. Fortunately, the unit is compact and lightweight enough so that turning it around is not a problem, just an annoyance. A side indentation would make things much easier.

This Instant Solo doesn't offer anything fancy, not like upper-end Keurigs and those from other companies. I don't think it needs more bells and whistles, though. It does the job in a compact design. Most simple brewers don't offer three sizes of cups, and most don't include a basket for your own grounds. Instant includes the things that most users will want.

You will never again have to worry about your coffee tasting good, or getting that pesky coffee flavor in your morning brew.

This coffee maker was so brilliantly bad, that after a full week of multiple daily brews, and a wife that was tired of me whining about how horrifically gross the 'coffee' tasted, she demanded I leave a review on Amazon. I don't like leaving negative reviews, but I am a public servant, and the public needs to be protected from this dangerous and disgusting conspiracy by Instant Pot to get into the 'coffee-brewer' game.

Buyer beware. You will regret every dollar you didn't spend on a Keurig.

As a matter of fact, the cheap coffee pots in hotel bathrooms make better coffee than this machine.

If you like the taste of hot water run through the soft cheap recycled Chinese plastic they typically use to make clown noses, then you'll love this machine. But if you like the taste of coffee, I'd advise chewing on discarded paper coffee filters from the trash before subjecting your soul to the morning torments of this counter-top torture contraption.

Overall, I really like this coffee maker and we've been using it daily now for almost 3 months with no issues. We have very limited counter space, so the fact that this takes up narrow space is perfect for us. It's very sleek looking. Since it's white though, we have to constantly clean it because when the coffee brews and pours into the cup, it tends to splash and leave marks all over the machine.

The one thing that I don't like about this, and it's probably not a huge issue for many but it is for me when I'm in a rush - this doesn't warn you when you don't have enough water to brew whatever desired oz cup you choose. The Keurig doesn't even let you start it if there isn't enough water. This one will start and once the water runs out, you have a 1/3 or 1/2 made cup of coffee and you have to basically fill it up and start over. It DOES beep when the water runs out, but in my opinion, it's too late at that point. So pay attention to your water reservoir and just keep it full if you drink coffee multiple times a day/every day.

The settings are great with the 8, 10, and 12oz options. The coffee turns out really good which IS something important to note. Some coffee makers simply don't make good coffee. Of course, the coffee itself is a huge factor, but some machines don't measure out quite right (that's one reason we switched to a Chemex several years ago).

Finally, the only pods that fit this are the K-cups. I've purchased other pods that say they are compatible, but they are not. The other nice plus is that it comes with a reusable pod, so we simply pour the contents of those pods into that. Problem solved.

I can deal with that. But, the coffee holder has a little lid with a small metal tab that must be inserted into a slit in the lip of the holder and that is a bit daunting especially when I am just barely awake. I have to carefully place it, being sure it is mating, or the coffee maker top will not close. Maybe other makers have a similar challenge but I haven't owned one previously.

It is exactly what I wanted and brews a great cup of coffee. I absolutely love that it comes with a reusable coffee pod that you can use to brew your own ground coffee. At the same time, it can brew any K-cups available on the market, so that you can make any variety of flavored coffee drinks, cappuccinos, hot chocolate, hot cocoa, teas, etc. The machine is very compact and takes a small amount of space in your kitchen while still having a good size water tank that is enough for at least 3 cups of coffee. I love the red color. It looks very stylish especially in combination with its sleek touch screen user interface.

While I love this machine so far, there is one minor flaw that I noticed: Unfortunately the machine does not recognize if the water tank is about to go empty and as result may suck air into the brewing unit which can then cause a big mess. It happened to me twice already. The machine will stop and beep and light will flash to tell you you ran out of water. But when you refill it with water and restart the brewing process, it will pump out that sucked in air and the coffee will splash everywhere. This issue could be easily solved by having a water level read and automatic shutoff below a certain water level.

Overall, I am in love with this single cup brewer due to its great coffee making abilities and variety of coffee drinks it can make. The machine is fairly pricey at $100 at the time of this review.

Brew Sizes, 40oz. Water Reservoir, Black (Black)"" is one of the better ones. It is simple to use, straight forward, and it just works. Plug in power, fill up the water reservoir, insert your favorite K-cup pod, pick your brew size, and wah-la, a great cup of coffee magically delivered! And the coffee that it brewed, is as good as it gets, for K(eurig)-cups.

This ""Instant Solo Coffee Maker"" also comes with a reusable coffee pod that you can fill with any grounded coffee, and the unique design of its reusable pod is just better than most that I had used before. This particular feature is going to save you a lot of money as you don't have to go for the single serve k-cup pods. The pod is intended to hold 2tbsp/12g of grounded coffee, so each lb of grounded coffee can make almost 40 pods/cups, that will cost much less than you going out and buy K-cup pods.

I also appreciate the 40oz water reservoir, it is a good size and will last me a few days rather than me needing to fill it up every day. I do use the ""BOLD"" feature, and this will increase the brewing time while allowing more flavor to be extracted from the coffee. Lastly, this is one of the few coffee maker that actually have an ""altitude"" mode (for use of this coffee maker at 5000+ ft above sea level) that would adjust the temperature of the water, to make sure your coffee is brewed at the optimal water temperature.

Currently this machine (the black version) is on sale for $78. This is quite a deal as that is probably cheaper than any Keurig-branded machine.

We go through a lot of coffee, as well as coffee makers, including the “K” brand. But we also using a combination of K-Cups, as well as coffee we grind ourselves and then brew in drip pots. We decided to give this combo maker a try to see how well it would work for us for both coffee types.

First, from a design perspective, I am really pleased with it’s trim design and how little space it actually takes up on a counter top, so that was a plus. From an operation perspective, it is very easy to use. There are simple touch buttons on the top for on/off, “bold”, and then 3 different cup sizes. The one thing that we are still adjusting too are the touch buttons. They are sensitive, so when you just wipe the top to clean it a bit, it will come on easily. It’s no big deal, but a definite adjustment to the raised buttons you have to physically push.

Making coffee is simple. It pierces the K-cups easily, and brews a cup of coffee as you would expect.

For ground coffee, you just fill the included reusable K-cup pod with 2 TBSP of your coffee of choice, and brew the same way as a normal K-Cup. It does help to have one of the K-cup funnel scoops to make filling the reusable pod easy. The resulting coffee is not as good as the drip coffee method to me, but then again I have never really like the fine-mesh wire filters used with these types of reusable pods because they still allow some of the really fine grounds to get through, which changes the taste. More than likely I’m going to get some of the small paper filters to use as well to help with that part. I also think it is best to use the “bold” button with the reusable pods to slow the water down a bit.

Overall it is a great machine, sleek minimal design, looks nice on the counter top, and makes a quick cup of coffee.",Color: White,false,true,

I like this coffee maker and use it mon thru Fri at work. I personally only do 8oz coffee and started using the bold button. Coffee comes out extremely hot so be careful. I like how slim this machine is and it's ease of use. Again you don't have to only use kcups, it has a filter to use ground coffee as well. I clean my machine with wipes. I have not had any issues with my machine. I even just do hot water alone for ramen cup of soup. I haven't had any coffee grounds inside the water.

I had an issue with my original and contacted customer service directly with instant Pot company and they were great. They were very helpful and resolved my problem.

Negatives: would give it 5 stars except for 2 things. 1) The way the coffee pours into your cup causes a LOT of splash. It will make mess. I fixed this by putting an unopened can of tuna under my mug so it is closer to the dispenser which stopped the mess. 2) If you use the basket do not fill it above the screen. If you do the water will back up and overflow. It will run out inside the machine and out along the basket handle to the outside.

I wanted one that gave me the option of using both pod and ground coffee. I was very familiar with the Instant Pot brand, so I decided to try this one.

I’m pretty happy with this coffee maker. It has a very small footprint and takes up little counter space when it’s out. It’s quite tall which is both a good and bad thing…it’s good because you can fit a travel mug under it easily…it’s bad because it’s hard to find a cabinet in the camper tall enough to put it in.

I like the fact that the ‘mock K-cup’ they give you has a scoop built into it. It’s makes it a lot easier to use, and you don’t have to go searching for a coffee scoop to use it.

This coffee maker brews pretty quickly…not as fast though as a real Keurig machine. It takes about 90 seconds for my 10 ounce cup.

The one thing that I do not like about this coffee maker is that there are too many loose parts…and they don’t stay put. The drip tray just rests on the coffee makes and slides off every time you move it. And the water reservoir…when it’s empty…doesn’t really seat well in the machine and falls off too. And the water reservoir lid doesn’t sit down far enough in the tank to keep it in place.

But this coffee maker does make a decent cup of coffee. I like the look and size of it. I just wish it stayed together better.",Color: White,false,true,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WI7BruPNL.jpg

My daughter was looking for a single-serve coffee maker that she could use loose ground coffee, as she's environmentally conscious of the plastic pod waste, as well as being able to use the pods for my elderly mom who prefers that convenience method. The size was also an issue as counter space was limited. She also expressed to me that most single-serve machines that we've used in the past, fell short of delivering a hot cup of coffee, so we added temperature to our wanted features list.
Well, after researching so many coffee makers here on Amazon, and reading a plethora of reviews, I decided on this Instant Pot brand, and I'm so happy with my choice!
First, this maker is made with quality components. The plastic is solid and heavy. The size is also space-saving, yet it still has a nice size water reservoir where you don't need to be filling it back up with each use. The controls are conveniently displayed on top of the machine with smart buttons. You can choose between three cup sizes and also brew strength. And she loves the soft audible chime that alerts when the brew is complete.
The included coffee ground basket has a handle so scooping and placement into the machine couldn't be easier.
But the best by far is the temperature of the coffee and the speed of making it. She can finally add cold almond milk from the fridge and still have a hot cup of coffee. It also fits her tall tumbler so coffee on the go is easy.
I've been a big proponent of the more popular brand maker that starts with a ""K"" thinking it was the best in coffee makers, but, in my opinion, this Instant Pot 2-in-one coffee maker makes a better cup of coffee. I can enthusiastically recommend this coffee maker for its quality and the delicious coffee it makes.

While it worked fine, we were looking to get a second one to place in our guest bedroom. When this popped up, I was immediately drawn to it for its water reservoir tank and the streamlined look. The touch button controls made this sleek little machine that much more appealing. We were not disappointed.

I love that it takes up little space, despite its water reservoir. It actually has a smaller footprint than our Keurig did, but that’s likely due to the age of the Keurig as newer models are probably slimmer. I love that it came with a reusable coffee filter for the times we want to use fresh ground beans rather than K-cups. While we have yet to use it, the quality of the reusable filter is excellent.

There is a “bold” option that is supposed to allow for a slower brew which makes the cup of coffee stronger. I’ve only used the “bold” option so I’ve not had the opportunity to compare it with the regular brew, but I can say that even using the “bold” option, the coffee is ready lickity-split! It also tastes great.

The option for 8, 10 or 12 ounce is also a nice feature that was missing on our basic Keurig. Having a reservoir makes it so convenient to select which size you want without pre-measuring the water before each brew. The added bonus of the reservoir means you don’t need to have a close water source nearby, making it a great choice for rooms other than the kitchen or bathroom. I also appreciate that this little machine accommodates taller mugs and thermoses.

Cleanup is a breeze. Certainly much easier than our older Keurig. I do find that the grey color shows splatters and drips much easier, so a wipe down is necessary after each brew to maintain cleanliness. Speaking of drips and splatters, I’ve found that removing the K-cup after brewing causes a few drips to trickle out. Keep your cup in place during removal of the K-cup and that problem is easily solved. Otherwise, you’ll find yourself cleaning out the drip tray after each use.

I am so thrilled with this little single-serve coffeemaker. It has all the features I was looking for, and then some. I recommend!",Color: Grey,false,true,

Just to be clear, it never claimed to be a compact unit, so no fault of the brewer, but it appeared to be a bit smaller than most, but it's actually comparable to others.

I grind whole beans, then put them into this reusable coffee pod. The results are good and the whole process is simple. I just have a couple of minor complaints.

One, if you actually fill the pod with 12 grams of coffee, it will leak water onto your counter. I was trying to get all 12 ounces of grounds into the pod, so I'd get a stronger brew. Well, when I came back, water had basically ran from the lid of the pod to the handle and dripped out of the unit and onto my counter. Since then, I've made sure to leave a little room in the pod and haven't had a problem. Also, the filter does let some sludge in, so I wouldn't slam that last gulp of coffee. I'm personally experimenting with larger grounds to see if it'll keep the sludge down without altering the taste too much.

Aside from those minor issues, this is a great feature for the Solo and works much better than other reusable pods I've used, including Keurig's own reusable pod.

A bonus, however, was that the maker was red and matched my mom’s red and black kitchen décor and other appliances; product’s description identified the color as maroon, but it appeared redder to my mom and me.

The INSTANT POT Coffee Maker was sleek in appearance and didn’t take up too much counter space. Mom really liked that she could remove the water reservoir to fill and was excited to get the companion reusable pod with handle, because she had never seen or used one before, and she’s accumulated a variety of ground coffee to brew. I also needed to find a coffee maker that was user-friendly and one that wasn’t embellished with a whole bunch of bells and whistles – one less complicated to operate, and this coffee maker fit that bill.

The multiple brew sizes were also a big hit for mom, as she tends to drink her coffee so slowly that it gets cold. Mom, now, makes multiple small cups of coffee or tea throughout day, because the speed to which the coffee machine produced the coffee, was relatively fast, and she didn’t have to stand and wait around a lengthy amount of time in order to collect another cup. Moreover, mom was able to use one K-cup pod multiple times, because she’s brewing only 8 ounces at a time – she claimed the additionally brewed cups produced were still robust in flavor.

The INSTANT POT machine really did brew a steamy hot cup of coffee in 90 seconds, and my mom found that out when she placed her finger under the group head to check whether the coffee was coming out hot or not – and yes, the coffee singed her finger. Asked why she did that, mom said that, “the machine started so quickly,” that she “didn’t think that the water could possibly be hot in that short amount of time” – lesson learned.

You can use disposable K-cups, but while we have used them at work, banks, doctor's offices, and friends' houses, we're not fans. The empty K-pods which end up in landfills, limited choices of coffee, and price were all negative factors from our point of view. However, the grounds from the reusable pod of this device disappear easily into a compost collector, a window box, or even the trash (last resort), all without adding to plastic waste. Whatever coffee you choose can be purchased ground or ground from whole beans at home, and spooned into the sturdy, reusable, fine wire mesh pod to brew each fresh cup of coffee. Not doing the math for the cost of K-cups, we do know that our costs for my husband's coffee throughout the day did not go up or down after we got this, as he uses the same amount of coffee per cup as before.

Experimenting with the settings, he found that brewing a cup with the wire pod filled to about an eighth inch from the top (giving a little head room so that it is easy to close), selecting ""Bold"", 8 oz works best for him, but loves that different mugs and cups of all shapes and sizes fit. A finer or coarser grind of the coffee of your choice, different brew size, plus a choice of settings, all give you control over the results. So far, my husband has tried two brands, and two different grinds (he grinds the beans at home), and is looking forward to trying more, though he says he is not in a hurry, as he has been getting excellent results with the current selection. For the solitary coffee-drinker, which he is, as I'm allergic to the magical beans, we highly recommend this coffee maker. You get only one cup at a time, but it is absolutely fresh and there is no pot being kept warm and becoming undrinkable. Instant does not recommend this for tea, as this is a pour over method of coffee brewing, and tea leaves need to steep, which finally explains why the tea which came out of the bank's and doctors' offices K-cup brewers was essentially tasteless.

My husband also wants to point out that the controls are very easy to read, (lit circles around your selections!), and the soft end-of-brew-cycle beep is not likely to awaken a sleeping spouse or child, but can be turned on and off. Also a big plus is the high altitude mode, since we love to travel to and camp (obviously with amenities) in the high desert of New Mexico. This is slim, so a much better traveler than other single brew, K-cup type coffee makers we've encountered.

So, given how pleased my family has been with our “Instant Pot”, this Solo coffee maker already had a leg up when we decided to get a K-cup machine. In short, this Solo is an easy to use, no fuss, high quality machine that does its job very well. My family has been using it regularly for a few weeks now and the following are a few standout impressions …

* The Solo is a compact machine that doesn’t take up a huge amount of counter space. It is comparable in size to a simple, no frills, standard 8-10 cup coffee maker. Its water reservoir is easy to access, lift up and remove, and drop back in when filled. Fumbling around is not required;
* The inclusion of a reusable coffee pod is a welcome bonus. It is a proprietary housing with a combination cover+handle that securely snaps together and is dropped into a recessed slot to lock it in. Although the unit works well on the whole, on a few occasions I’ve had fine coffee grounds pass through the pod’s wire mesh into my cup. So, keep in mind that the grind of the coffee you put in this pod will make a difference in what, if anything, you have left over in the bottom of your cup; and, lastly …
* The Solo’s “Bold” brew selection button can, and does, make a difference. Pressing this button slows down the brewing process to allow the heated water additional time to pass thru and interact with the ground coffee. My experience has been that its effect varies with the brand of coffee I’m using. Using this “Bold” button can/will give the cup a boost that will be noticeable, and enjoyable, as long as you don’t expect an espresso strength brew to appear in your cup.

The takeaway: This Instant Solo coffee maker is a well made, K-cup ready, machine that comes with a reusable pod that allows you to use your favorite bagged coffee. It has an ergonomic, well thought out, design that does not take up a lot of counter space. It is made by the same folks who have been making the popular “Instant Pot” pressure cooker since 2010.

What sealed the deal was the included refillable cup- I love my particular brand of coffee and the refillable cup that is included with the coffee maker is perfect for it. And the ""Bold"" feature that allows for a stronger brew is what the gods dreamed about.

It arrived very well packaged, I am a secret admirer of quality packaging. Not a scratch or bump, just perfect.

I rinsed everything (has a 40 oz water reservoir) and filled the cup with my favorite grounds. The resulting cup of coffee was excellent! Great flavor (no chemical or plastic taste ) and perfect strength.

Drip coffee as in regular coffee - there is nothing unique or special about the ""K"" cup fad that so many of these after-market ""K"" coffee machine manufacturers are piggybacking onto to sell some units. A small, single-serve sized container of 'some' coffee grounds is penetrated by a (very!) small needle which dribbles hot water over the grounds. Basically like what your grandparents' Mr. Coffee does but scaled down 90%.

As you've probably guessed from my wording so far, I'm not super enamored with this machine - especially for $100 (yes, we bought it pre-sale....sigh). However, it's taken me a while to figure out WHY I'm not super enamored with it - because the coffees I made myself from it last weekend were - quite frankly - a violation against nature.

So last night, we broke out the kitchen scales, disassembled a bad K-cup (never drunk one, never will) and weighed the contents. 8.5grams of coffee. Then tossed the contents. We then filled the provided grounds basket that comes with this machine with our own (good) coffee, dumped the contents out onto the scale and measured 9.5grams of coffee. Hmmm. We added more coffee to the machine's small basket, tamped them down lightly (which you're NOT supposed to do) and added MORE until it was full to the brim, then dumped out the contents and weighed them. 12grams. Eureka!

So, this machine purports to make either an 8oz, 10oz or 12oz coffee, with an added ""BOLD"" button that you can press at any point. LIES! Lies I tell you!

The golden rule of coffee:water ratio is about 1:17. 1 part coffee to 17 parts water, give or take depending on how strong you like it. To save you some math and just give you the tl;dr of this whole equation - you basically need about 12 grams of coffee grounds to make a DECENT 6oz coffee. Yes, you read that correctly and no - I didn't make a typo - 6OZ COFFEE.

The very SMALLEST coffee this machine will make is an 8oz cup. The very LARGEST amount of coffee you can get into it's tiny, K-cup compatible compartment is AT MOST 12grams - and that is with some tamping (which you're not supposed to do) and ending up with the water needle buried in the grounds (which you're not supposed to do).

Tl;dr again - every coffee this machine makes is EXTREMELY watered down, and more than likely far, far over-extracted. Which is weird because from the sour taste of my weekend travesties, I was under the impression that it was UNDER-extracted....but whatever. Either way, the coffee is bad, and the machine does not even remotely allow for adequate coffee:water ratios.",Color: Black,false,false,

Less than 2 months after obtaining the Instant Solo, it has failed. Either the system won't turn on, or if it does, when I start to touch the touchpad to make my brew selection, the display shuts off and the machine is not responsive. I'm assuming that there's some kind of short or defect in the control hardware. I would reach out to the manufacturer for repair or replacement, since it has a one-year warranty, but per the warranty I would be financially responsible for shipping the unit to Canada, which from my location would be at least $35 via UPS. As much as I like the unit, I'm not willing to spend that much just to initiate consideration for repair/replacement.

*** ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I've had so many different Keurig brewers over the years that I simply refuse to buy them anymore. I do use the standard K-Cup pods for convenience, however.

There are a few things in particular that I like about this unit:

+ It's sleek and smooth with a nice, rounded design for a more contemporary appeal.
+ It serves up a warm cup of coffee, brewed at the proper strength.
+ It has a Bold option to make the output from the pod a bit stronger, which is likely my favorite feature.
+ The top of the unit is a touchscreen with simple, easy-to-use options: On/Off, Bold and Size Selection. The options you select are outlined by a white circle for your confirmation.
+ The unit emits a tone at both the start and end of the brew cycle. The tone is quiet yet stands apart from the rest of the beeping kitchen.
+ The unit holds 40 ounces of water in its storage tank, and is easily removed and refilled as needed.

What I'm not crazy about:

- The lid to the water reservoir is a matte, clouded finish, so you have to look at the side to see how much water is left. The top doesn't match the body and looks out of place.
- The brewer is white. I didn't have an option to pick it up in black or red that fits better into my decor.

The brewer is fast and quiet. I used the bold feature as I like my morning cup to have some impact, and the taste difference is noticeable. Like other brewers I've used with K-cups, I always insert and press down the pod so that the base is pierced before I close the lid. This ensures no leakage or back spray.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you're using a K-cup with this machine, it's really important to press on the edges of the cup to pierce the bottom when you place it in the machine. If you don't, it's possible that the K-cup will ""explode"" or you'll get a cup of hot water. Always make sure the K-cup is properly seated before closing the lid.",Color: White,false,true,

With the water tank only being 40 ounces, after 3 cups it needs to be refilled (which is fine). You can use this to make hot chocolate or just on-demand hot water too!

The perk of this device is you're able to use your own coffee grinds in the reusable pod or use any K cup pod from whichever brand without issue. It's fast! It has an option to make the coffee regular or rich AND three brew sizes which are 8,10 and 12 ounces.

The biggest con, with all of these k-cup/single coffee makers, is it has no warmer. You either have to heat up the cream/milk/etc before you brew your cup or reheat the freshly brewed coffee in the microwave. I just wish you had the option to keep the coffee warm until you were ready for it.

𝐗 Cons:
➖ Hot water can squirt out so don’t stand too close to it.
➖ Water spillage if moved with a full water tank/reservoir.
➖ Coffee doesn't stay hot very long because there isn't a warmer.

✔️Pros:
➖ An 8 oz of coffee brews in under 100 seconds
➖ You can choose a bold or regular brew cycle
➖ 3 cup sizes to choose from 8,10 and 12 ounces
➖ You can stop the brewing at anytime
➖ Coffee pod easy to clean immediately after use
➖ Can use any brand of k-cup pods

During the first COVID-19 lockdown, I started looking into making the best cup of coffee for me, out of boredom and to keep my mind off of the terror. I was successful at keeping my mind occupied, but not as successful at the coffee part.

I started out by trying drip coffee makers from various brands, including some that were well rated by experts, including machines from OXO and Technivorm. For one reason or another, they didn’t work out. Mind you, I was looking for single-serve options, because I tend to only drink one cup in the morning per day.

I moved on to pour overs, trying drippers from both Kalita and Hario. I would've tried a Chemex, but again, I only drink one cup per day, so the Chemex would've been too big. I got myself a nice burr grinder, gooseneck electric kettle, scale and got to work. To my disappointment, I could never get the taste quite right or consistent using either the Kalita or the Hario. I was also kind of put off at how expensive the Kalita filters were, so I moved on yet again.

I finally decided to give Keurigs a try, despite their reputation for weak coffee, high cost, and wasteful non-recyclable K-cups. The convenience was great, but the taste didn’t suit me and using the reusable Keurig pods made them taste even worse. At a loss, I flip flopped between using my pour over drippers and my OXO 8-cup drip coffee maker.

Then came the Instant Pot Solo 2-in-1.

REVIEW:
I've been using the Instant Pot Solo for about 6 weeks now and find the taste using the reusable pod to be good enough. I only brew 8 ounces on bold and it’s fine. I grind one scoop of beans using my burr grinder, then pour it into the reusable pod and it’s just the right amount. I did once try to put as much grounds as possible into the reusable pod and I think that caused it to leak. Frustratingly, I noticed it leaking at other times too and I couldn’t figure out why. I’ve tried to be more mindful about not overfilling the pod and making sure that the pod is seated properly before brewing. I haven’t experienced any leaking lately, so hopefully there are no more issues.

Using the Instant Pot Solo is a cinch. I like that the water reservoir is removable, which can make it easier to fill and clean. Like most single serve coffee makers, it does splatter quite a bit, but if you use a tall tumbler, it minimizes the splatter. Still, you’ll want to wipe the Instant Pot Solo down about once a week to keep it clean and looking nice. The touch button controls are simple, responsive and a joy to use. I power it on, select bold brewing, then select the size and it starts brewing. Within a few minutes, my coffee is ready. The tones the buttons make when you press them and when the brewing is done are pleasant and not annoying like a lot of coffee makers.

The Instant Pot Solo isn't large and takes up very little space. It also doesn’t expel any steam from the machine itself, so it should be safe to run while underneath your kitchen cabinets. It’s so small and self contained that I’m reconsidering whether or not keeping my burr grinder on my counter is worth the trade off. I may go back to a small blade grinder or maybe even just go back to pre-ground coffee.

I’m not a fan of Keurig K-cups, but totally get the convenience. While using the reusable pod on the Instant Pot Solo isn’t quite as convenient, I prefer it to using the overpriced and hard to recycle K-cups. I really wanted to perfect the pour over method, but I just sucked at it and it was too much of a hassle, not to mention how stupid expensive the Kalita paper filters are. The best cup of coffee I made during this entire journey was from a Technivorm, but the single serve version was designed so poorly I couldn’t see myself using it day in and day out. The Instant Pot Solo 2-in-1 has been the best fit for me so far with the right balance of compromises, features, and convenience. It’s also reasonably priced. What’s not reasonably priced is their reusable pod, which you can purchase on its own and I’d love to have. Aside from that, no major complaints and I’m happily using the Instant Pot Solo 2-in-1 almost everyday.",Color: Grey,false,true,

I got my hopes up when I saw this offering from the makers of Instant Pot, and I'm glad to say it lived up to my expectations.

The maker itself is very light and is mostly a thin plastic, but as long as you set it up and don't move it around all the time it shouldn't be an issue.

The removable reservoir holds about 40 ounces of water, which is good for 3-5 cups depending on cup size (it gives you options for 8, 10, and 12 ounces). This is a nice middle ground between having to fill it up every time and having a big reservoir where the water sits long enough you want to dump it.

The controls are very intuitive, with five buttons overall - a power button, a button to switch bold flavor on and off, and three size buttons. Selecting a size button starts the brewing. Each button helpfully illuminates a ring around it when it's active; considering the hoops I had to jump through on some other third-party coffee makers, this was a welcome change of pace.

It depends on your taste, of course, but you're more likely to want to have the ""bold"" option on as you use larger cups. There's a noticeable difference in intensity between an 8-ounce brew and a 12-ounce brew, though it's not as pronounced as some other brands.

There is not really much to go over. I will say, this has replaced my current Keurig since it does kCups just as well and is made to also do ground coffee.

Build quality and design: I love how slender the unit is. It has a bit of depth, but it doesn't take up much space widthwise. The cup tray has a ton of vertical space for large and small cups. The drain tray is easily removeable and durable. The rear reservoir is large, easy to place, easy to remove, and easy to clean. Everything about this machines is built well and well designed. It also looks attractive.

Functionality: Not really much to discuss. There is a power button, and 3 fill sizes. Each setting pours exactly the stated amount of water and the liquid is hotter than most Keurig dispensers. The past part here is that the included ground coffee scoop is well made and thought out. This really makes a good cup of coffee from ground.

I really do not have a negative here, even after a week of use. Maybe if I were to nitpick, I would suggest that Instant use conventional shaped packaging for products.

Lots of good features, so let's start!
The insert one uses to place your own coffee grounds in, is absolutely the best designed one that I have ever seen, and this is keeping in mind that I have had probably over 10 different machines that use K-Cups. (I used to collect various coffee makers, both old and new, with a collection of about a hundred before downsizing, and even had one of the first Keurig home units, back when they were made with a lot of metal parts and what plastic parts they did use, were excellent quality and substantial)
The mesh is more fine than some of the cheap generic ones, and it clips together tightly. Works beautifully, as long as you have a medium grind. Nothing too coarse, or it won't extract enough coffee flavor, and nothing too fine because it will clog.

Now let's compare this Instant Pot brand with the Keurig Mini, because both are compact size and about the same price, if you're getting the Mini that has the coffee strength selection feature, which the Instant Solo has.

As you can see, it's just a little larger than the Keurig branded mini. It's also not as streamlined of a design. Keurig has the edge here, think Zephyr and those clean, modern curves. However, you're trading off to be getting some good features. The Mini does not have a water tank that goes beyond what you put in it for one cup. The amount of water determines the cup size. The Instant has a water tank, and you can choose your cup size via buttons on the top. That may or may not matter to you, it depends on how small of a unit you want. Most people will fill the cup with cold water, and put it in the Mini reservoir. With Keurig, you are cooling off the mug by doing this, thus losing a bit of heat.
The build, in terms of quality, are comparable, but I think the Keurig brand edges it out just a little bit for one little reason. I show in the photograph how you can see the plastic seam at the top of the Instant branded coffee maker. These tiny little details bring down what would otherwise be a quality look. It ain't easy making plastic look quality but this is one of those things that makes an item made of plastic look downright cheap.

But my favorite Instant Solo feature is being able to adjust according to altitude.

Is a high altitude adjustment absolutely necessary for coffee makers?
If you love coffee, the answer is absolutely yes!
The reason for this is the boiling point of water at high altitude. Unless you adjust your coffee maker, the water flowing through the grounds is going to be too hot.
Water boils at 212° at sea level. I'm in the mountains, and water boils a full 10° lower at my altitude.
Something to always keep in mind, if your coffee is too bitter, it might be that the water you're using is too hot. If your coffee has that sourness that we sometimes associate with coffee beyond its expiration, it could be that your water isn't hot enough. So yes, that variance in temperature can mean quite a bit.

The Instant company clearly gets it in terms of how important these things are, right down to another great feature of this coffee maker. You will notice that the water pauses and continues a few times. Just like with pour over coffee, the machine is wetting the grounds in a manner which is going to extract the most flavor.

Some negatives...
When removing it from the protective packaging after pulling it out of the box, I could see several flaws. Minor and not so minor. The scratches at the top of the unit are bad enough to where I question quality control. That's a red flag for two reasons. First of all is thier quality control lacking? Second of all, was this product rushed through production to get it on the shelves, which translates as the first batch of units at high risk for issues? You can barely see in the photograph the black stains at the bottom, but since the unit is white, it's kind of noticeable in person. They're very small, but they don't wash off.
That goes back to the above mentioned cheaper build. I think the Keurig model uses a better quality of plastic, little flaws like the plastic seam cheapen the look of the Instant model.
This is very minor, but when you put the reservoir tank back on the unit, it pops a little, so if you have it filled to the max you're going to probably spill a little water unless you're very careful placing the tank on. No big deal.

So, in closing, my suggestion, especially if you are giving one of these as a gift, unpack it and take a close look at it before the time comes that you can no longer return it. Solo is comparably priced, with more features than similar single cup units.
I hope that the comparison, and the photos, help you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to invest in this offering from Instant Pot. In my opinion, because of my altitude, I believe the brewed K-Cup from the Instant tastes a little better than the Keurig branded model.
It would rate five stars from me if the quality control was tighter.

UPDATE:
As mentioned, this machine will wet the grounds in the K-Cup a number of times during brewing, and most importantly, it will wet the grounds and pause right at the start of the cycle.
Few machines do this. Some of the Bunn home coffee machines come to mind.
But here's the thing. The older Jura models would do the same thing, but the first wetting of the grounds was with room temperature, not hot, water. I had one of those, spent thousands for it, and I found myself putting a cup to catch those drips, and then putting the cup I would drink from, underneath the spout.
So yes, I put my finger underneath to check the temperature of the first few drips coming out of the K-Cup brewing in the Instant Solo.

Let's just say, I took one for the team!
Ouch!

Overall we are really happy with it. It brews quickly and the coffee tastes good. I like that you can easily choose brew size and strength. I like the large reservoir and that it's easy to fill and to clean.
It brews coffee hot but it doesn't have to cool down much before it's a temp ready to drink. For me it doesn't at all because I like my coffee hot while my husband doesn't and that is one thing he likes about this machine that he doesn't have to put a cube of ice in or wait a long time for his coffee to be ready to drink.
The only issue I've had is that sometimes when using K-cup coffee pods it doesn't want to close all the way before brewing. When that happens I'll hit the brew and it will brew a little bit and then I'll have to hit it again (and at that point it sometimes will close all the way if I push down again) and it will brew the rest. That isn't an issue with the reusable pod, only on certain K-cup pods. It still brews them, just takes a little extra effort.
*Update* We've been using this daily for months and I'm updating it to five stars because of how much we like it. The reusable pod works so well and we've found it's saved us money because we aren't brewing a full pot and wasting coffee that we don't drink. We just brew a cup when we want it and so our beans and ground coffee last longer than it typically would. I'd really like to be able to buy a couple more of those to have on hand.",Color: Black,false,true,

It's made completely from plastic, but the plastics used are high quality and the machine looks and feels well made and robust. It looks great on the countertop.

The Instant is easy to use. Fill the tank, turn it on, add the coffee (either grounds or a k-cup), and choose the serving size. The machine also offers the option for a bold cup by brewing the coffee more slowly.

The coffee it makes is hot, and if you choose one of the smaller sizes, it has a pleasant flavor. The largest size tastes a bit watered down. The machine isn't too noisy in use and makes a cup of coffee fairly quickly. It spittles a bit and makes a slightly splashy mess on the machine and counter.

It's easy to clean and the brew chamber is removable. The touch controls on the top are also easy to keep clean.

It cooks quickly, and it's incredibly fast and easy to clean. The water reservoir on the back is a little bit larger so you can get several mugs out of this without refilling it. It is a little bit of hassle to move it to the side to pull out the water reservoir, but because it is larger it's worth it to me.

Contacted the company and waited on hold for 45 min. Was told to send them a video of the item malfunctioning. I’m hoping that they offer a replacement or my money back. Ugh I’m so bummed.
***update as of 9/8/22. The company is sending me a new unit. I’m hoping I don’t have a repeat of what happened with the first unit especially after reading more reviews of customers that experienced the same thing after a month. I will update this review after I receive the new pot and use it for a few months. Keeping my fingers crossed!",Color: Black,false,false,

I do not love this coffee maker now. I have discovered it makes my Kcup coffee to weak on the lowest 8oz serving. My coffee is like water with some flavor. ☹️
ALSO.... It's messy after it's finished brewing. It drips and sometimes makes a mess inside. Be careful removing the Kcup, you will likely get burned by how hot it is plus the dripping to get it to the trash can.
I would not recommend and regret selling both of my Keurigs!!!!!!

love love LOVE this coffee ☕ maker.
No start up time.
Turn on, hit brew, BAM! Starts brewing!!
I purchased a second one for the RV. Selling my Keurigs and not looking back!

*UPDATE* I had to deduct a star. ⭐
The only thing I do not like is it's messy.
After you open lod to drive used Kcup it drips on me and ALWAYS on the little drip pan area. I have to wipe it down every single use. Not just one drip but several.
I even got burned with one Kcup when I removed it. Dripped all over myself and the floor.
Very irritating, but it still makes delicious coffee ☕

*NOTE* I loved this machine so much I ordered a second. NEVER did it say ""USED"" But IT WAS!!!
It still had coffee splatter on the machine and in the drip tray. It was missing the coffee pod where you can brew your own!!!!!!

There is not really much to go over. I will say, this has replaced my current Keurig since it does kCups just as well and is made to also do ground coffee.

Build quality and design: I love how slender the unit is. It has a bit of depth, but it doesn't take up much space widthwise. The cup tray has a ton of vertical space for large and small cups. The drain tray is easily removeable and durable. The rear reservoir is large, easy to place, easy to remove, and easy to clean. Everything about this machines is built well and well designed. It also looks attractive.

Functionality: Not really much to discuss. There is a power button, and 3 fill sizes. Each setting pours exactly the stated amount of water and the liquid is hotter than most Keurig dispensers. The past part here is that the included ground coffee scoop is well made and thought out. This really makes a good cup of coffee from ground.

I really do not have a negative here, even after a week of use. Maybe if I were to nitpick, I would suggest that Instant use conventional shaped packaging for products.

Fast brewing compared to Keurig brand I also own. Shorter and about same width as Keurig. Spill plate works great and is easy to clean.

Cons:
Sputters coffee out and less constant drip than the Keurig. When using a small mug you can't put the mug against the back. It must be centered reasonably but not perfectly. 8 oz brew is true and you'll need 9-10oz mugs. It filled my 8oz slightly over the rim and thus I got to test and clean the spill plate.

I prefer the Keurig because I can brew 7 oz into an 8 oz cup by pouring the water from the cup into the tank. This has a prefill tank. Some people will prefer the prefilled. If so this is the one for you.

Reviewed this and rated it highly as it is quite a good coffee maker, that is until you accidentally let it run out of water. Once. Just once. And once is enough to break this thing. It does say in the instructions not to let it run out of water but I don't remember reading about the severe consequences.
Shame really. This was good.

So we bought one of those well marketed Keurig alternatives on Amazon about a year ago. For ground coffee and k cups. It lasted a few months and it was so bad we threw it out. Then we bought a Keurig with an attached milk frother and after six months it stopped working. And it's tiresome.
We got this and love it already. Im going to come back and tell you if it fails like the others but for now it feels like it's going to last. I hope so anyway.
It's so simple. The interface on the top is basically just four buttons. On/ off, bold and then three cup size options. To be honest we haven't used bold and only really go with 8oz cups because we are creatures of habit. But it's working perfectly. And we do use the coffee maker a lot.
The 40oz reservoir is fine and for two people and it's fairly easy to clean. The big benefit was the size of it. We were looking for something compact and this is it. It has to fit alongside the toaster and the tea kettle and the soda stream and all the other devices we ended up with.
I will come back, as I said, it it turns out this is another let down. But so far it appears to be a win.",Color: Black,false,true,
R3SUNWBN0EMGWI," DON'T BUY! No support & dead after making 16 cups of coffee",Bookwyrm,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFB5L26ZMR3M5IXB3TR7NBTIFEYA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,1,"May 9, 2022","Update #2:
I emailed the company at the address provided when I registered this Instant Solo coffee maker. No reply. Simply crickets.

This coffee maker made it through 2 more cups of coffee for a total of 16 cups during its career before spewing water everywhere and giving up the ghost. We went to my daughter’s office where her Keurig Slim had been sitting unused and full of water since mid-March 2020 when she was sent home to work at the start of the pandemic. Yeah, the Keurig still works fine despite its abandonment issues – okay, it thought it was on an extended vacation, so no worries there – and it’s gone on to prove that all the “defective” k-cups we’d been dealing with while using the Instant Solo were actually not defective at all. The Solo was putting out so much pressure, it was damaging the k-cups and filling our coffee with various amounts of grounds.

Sadly, the Instant Solo is a losing proposition all the way around. Very disappointing as I love my Instant Pot pressure cookers so much.

Update #1:
We ended up using this Instant Solo 2-in-1 Coffee Maker in my daughter’s room, where we had set up a coffee station for her. She used this for one cup of coffee per day and after about two weeks, it started dying. The pump was very, very loud and the water barely trickled out. This has only been used with filtered water, so that shouldn’t be an issue. And one cup per day should not tax any machine. Very frustrated, as I thought Instant would be a good brand after how good my Instant Pot pressure cookers are. Replacing this with a different brand. Too bad, because when it worked, it worked really well.

Original review:
This Instant Solo 2-in1 Coffee Maker works great. It got hot so fast and made coffee so quickly. It’s faster than our Keurig and very easy to use; it also seemed to get hotter than our Keurig. The k-cup pod works fantastically; not one iota of grounds sneaked out, and it held just the right amount of coffee. Overall, more than pleased with this Instant Solo. Definitely a step up from our Keurigs.

I took inventory of my k-cups and about 1/3 are the filter type pod so I just wasn’t comfortable using a brewer that wouldn’t fully close. I do hope they modify future versions of this to be compatible with such k-cups, as I wouldn’t hesitate to purchase an “Instant Solo 2” if I could properly fit my SF Bay pods in it!

This was an impulse buy one morning and I really don’t know what compelled me to purchase it, aside from it being $80 at the time. But I’m so glad I did! I actually have a Bunn MCU, which also brews K-cups or grounds and has a bold setting as well. So they’re similar in those ways. But I like that the Instant Solo has a smaller footprint, and I like the large tank (with the Bunn, it has a small internal tank to always have hot water, but unfortunately once you fill it, it’s never able to be emptied…as someone who likes to switch up brew methods and may not use a brewer for a few months, this is a big downside for me). I also like that this just has one small insert if you want to use grounds, vs the bulky “drawers” the Bunn has for each type of coffee/tea. Aesthetically, the Instant Solo looks modern and the touch screen gives it a sleek look. As for the most important thing, the liquid gold itself…that’s what surprised me the most. It truly holds its own with the Bunn. My husband loves a cup of joe that looks like motor oil, and even a medium roast on the bold setting can accomplish that for him with the Instant Solo.

Now for that caveat…it unfortunately won’t close all the way if you use a filter type pod, such as SF Bay! It does brew them (which surprises me that apparently there’s not a sensor that keeps it from brewing without the device head being latched), but it does make me a little nervous brewing pods without it being fully closed. There’s a lip on the pods and it’s longer on the filter style, and the “seat” for the lip is obviously designed to only fit the cup style. This is a pretty big downside to me because I really enjoy SF Bay and using compostable pods, and seems like a pretty big oversight by the folks at the Instant brand because it’s not future-proof (although that may be intentional; with as many Instant Pot models they release, they may want you to have to keep upgrading), with other K-cup brands expressing intentions to go fully compostable in the future.

Despite this caveat, it has still become my new everyday single serve coffeemaker, at least until the end of my return period when I decide if I can live with the “flaw”. If so, the Bunn (which overall, I DO like; despite the slight misgivings I’ve mentioned, it does brew stellar coffee) will be relegated to our travel brewer.",Color: Black,true,false,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615kKukjQYL.jpg

Two issues…1. The brew time is much slower. Not enough to be a deal breaker but definitely noticeable. 2.

It’s near two years old and works wonderfully. The “Instant” company in my opinion sure does focus on making quality products. To conclude I had two (competitor brand) solo coffee makers. Due to the inadequacy of the cleaning system they both burned out and made it to the trash.

Cons: I won’t call these cons, maybe a simple fix to the design of the coffee maker which I hope the manufacture reads.
Someone mentioned the rubber feet on the bottom of the unit making it difficult to slide the coffee maker on the countertop. Simplest solution a nice thin piece of fabric, a doily or a folded piece of paper towel. When it gets sloppy swap it out.
Someone also suggested using a 4” x 2” mini cake pan or a ramekin upside down for short coffee cups to prevent splash while brewing, love that idea. Or just simply use a taller cup.",Color: Grey,true,false,

It’s easy to use and works faster than the previous brewer as well. The included reusable basket is hit-or-miss; it usually works fine, save for the occasional fluke and dribble. The “bold” button is helpful and slows down the speed of brew, which sometimes tempers the splashing a little (depending on height of receiving vessel). Temperature is suitably hot-I need to wait a couple of minutes before I can drink what got dispensed. I can perceive what quibbles some write about this coffee brewer, but nowhere near the point of dealbreaker. I’ve only used standard prepacked K-cups (which seem distortedly shorter after use in this thing🤷🏻‍♀️) and the included reusable basket. Within that criteria, this works consistently well and is reasonably priced. I do wish I could find paper filter liners for the reusable basket that actually fit well.

Instant Brands has offered other appliances to popular effect-I couldn’t see how they’d brain fart on making a coffee brewer. I hope this has better durability than the other brand.

It’s simple I need a machine that is simple because at 4:30-5am I am in no mood to fuss with some tiny silver button that matches the machines color that I will only change the clock (whoops) and not make coffee.
I took the leap and bought this, and in the color blue. I in no way wanted another Kerig. Bland brewing and will succumb to descaling and never make “marginal Bland coffee again”. I also don’t need a giant coffee maker, and not going to buy a cheap 1 cup maker that will prolly only work for 3 months and then die.
This Coffee maker, is stylish - blue. The lid is also the touch screen, where the button is below glass. Power, 3 fill levels and a “bold” setting are what there is to press in the am.
Bold - it will pre moisten the grounds before brewing. It adds maybe 20 seconds more to the brewing process.
I love the Bold setting, it makes my coffee stand out.
Before this machine I had a single cup French press for 4 years. It finally broke and I decided to try something new, instead of buying another 4 cup machine that wil break in 5 months.
It’s value is excellent, a 1 cup with barely a water reservoir from Kerig and other brands will set u back around the same amount or more.
Style and footprint on the counter are perfect too.
Ease to clean and no descaling are huge bonuses.
The fact that it comes with a coffee pod for your own grounds was the “buy now” option I selected. As most make you buy those separately, and on those u have to touch the hot cup after, this one has a handle built onto it so u can immediately prepare and make another cup ( say if u had a friend over and needed 2 cup’s or whatever of coffee)

In conclusion the company on obviously sat and brainstormed and thought this completely though.

This is far more simple to operate than the keurig and it brews hotter coffee. It has less features and offers less cup sizes but I find 8,10 &12oz sizes is all I need and would use. The flavour using McCafe is not quite as good as the keurig but not enough difference to make me return it. Build quality is on par plus amazon has a 90 return or replace warranty on it and after that the manufactures 1yr warranty. That's excellent because most problems arise within those 90days. One major difference that gives this 5 stars is that it puts no coffee grinds in the cup of coffee. The keurig did unless you cleaned it out after every use. That was unacceptable this is the first of out 4 Keurigs that did that. I phoned them and they said that is normal because of the multiple punctures it makes in the pod. Maybe I had a bad machine because it died within 5mos. I no longer trust them so time will tell if Instant pot solo will prove to outlast and out perform over the next weeks and months.
