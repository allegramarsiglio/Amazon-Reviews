It's performed fairly well and seems to be easy to operate and clean. I have some observations and notes to offer here.

The term ""Multistream Technology"" is really just marketing fluff. Instead of a single water stream, it's distributed across the coffee ground surface via more holes for water. Coffee makers have been doing this for years, it's not a ""technology"", it's actually common sense.

Despite the unit's appearance, nearly the entirety of this device is plastic, including the prongs that create holes into the pod seal and disperse water--the prongs are colored to appear metallic. The reason for the use of plastic is cost which has allowed Keurig to achieve a significant markup from their base production cost.

That being said, it works very well and makes decent coffee. I would prefer metallic hardware, I'd pay more for it happily, as I don't like the clumsy feel of plastic. Box also didn't indicate whether this is BPA free, as I recall.",true,false,

I ordered this one because it was white and I am remodeling my kitchen and the white would look better than a black one. I also chose this one because it was slim line.

I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 for several reasons. First, some water spills over the filter leaving water and grounds in the top. My older/larger Keurig didn't do this. The second reason is it is very long so to fill the water tank I have to reach way back. This is the design...why it is slim. I think if I were to go back and order again, I would buy the one that isn't slim. I would get one with the tank on the side so it is easier to reach. This might not be a big deal for most, but I am 5' tall so such things are an issue.

One thing I want to point out, the other Keurigs have a water filter in the water tank. This one doesn't. Also, I'm not sure if it will tell me when it needs to be descaled as there isn't a surface with a readout. The only thing it has are buttons that show the ounce selection, on/off, start brew, and add water. Maybe the add water button might eventually show descale.

The Supreme machines are heavier and solid, they're easy to maintain. Most importantly, they brew a great cup of coffee quickly with no fuss, muss or backtalk. With proper care, they work beautifully for 10+ years. My current K Supreme Plus was mistakenly put into storage during a move so I purchased this smaller model until I can go retrieve my big machine in the spring.

This model is all plastic and feels very flimsy when closing the top. It makes decent coffee but doesn't feel durable. After approx 6 weeks of daily use, 1 cup per day, this machine started making snap-cracking electrical sounds during the brew cycle. When I stepped near to listen, the machine suddenly erupted in fire and immediately was furiously burning and melting, giving off toxic fumes and threatening to ignite the cabinets above the machine. Thankfully, I had a can of fire extinguisher in arm's reach and was able to quickly put out the fire. If I had not been standing right there when it happened this incident could easily have resulted in a house fire. The fumes from the burning/melting plastic were painful to lungs and stunk up the house. Cleaning up the charred, melted plastic was difficult and time consuming, the plastic had liquified and stuck to the countertop and the ceramic mug.

There were no exposed wires or obvious problems that might have caused this fire. I have never in all of my decades of adulthood had any kitchen appliance start a fire. I will stick with the higher end Keurig models but I would never buy or gift one of these little plastic models again.",true,false,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51GEv-SEr1L.jpg

It is not as noticeable when I use it just to get a cup of hot water for tea, but when coffee is made there are tons of specs of the coffee all over and it always has to be cleaned up. Keurig, you don't have engineers that design these products??? If so, there were no measures taken to continue to develop this model without it splashing. Unfortunately for me, I did not check the reviews on this product when I bought both of them. It was only when I used the second one that I realized it operated with splashing water just like the first one. I was so frustrated that I then went and looked at the reviews and I see it is a problem many have written about. Obviously Keurig doesn't care because people are still buying this model.

I pulled out the instructions, and step-by-step followed the descaling directions. I even purchased the Kuerig descaling liquid for compatibility. I was able to run the machine long enough to empty the descaling liquid out of the reservoir, but upon refilling to flush, the machine no longer turned on. I had 2 phone calls with customer service, and YouTube and Reddit provided many more troubleshooting steps than Kuerig customer support. When nothing worked, I was instructed to email my receipt (luckily I purchased via Amazon, because I don't have a copy of a receipt) to be considered for a replacement machine.

A replacement machine is the least I deserve in this situation, but I really want to understand why the machine stopped turning on during routine cleaning, and why the company is okay with hearing that such a thing has happened.",true,false,

Purchased August 22, 2021, and already now on September 24th we're done with it.

1) Takes a surprisingly long time for the coffee to make a cup.
2) The thing sputters and splatters the coffee into the cup and noticed from very beginning that this thing splatters coffee all over the surrounding counter space which was annoying but we dealt with it
3) Now 1-month in and 50% of the cups of coffee that this makes are full of coffee grinds and undrinkable -- using only Peets and Dunkin K-cups -- and requires significant cleanup of the k-cup holder to clear out the overflow grinds left behind
4) Just this morning noticed the issue others have had where I entered 10 oz and was lucky to get 6 oz of relatively grind-free coffee

So, unless you want to go thru 4 k-cups to get a single cup of coffee and spend half your time cleaning out the insides of this machine, I'd look elsewhere.

But we've been planning on retiring the old man and the opportunity presented itself with Christmas. I gifted my wife with the K-Slim, Black.
Pros:
1. It does not take up much space at all. The old Keurig was 2 1/2 times the size of this little feller.
2. It's way less complicated than the old one. It automatically powers on when you open the K-cup compartment. You load your K-cup, prefilled or reusable. You close the breach and press and select your cup size, by pushing one of the three cup size buttons, then press start. Just make sure there's an adequately-sized cup wating for the brew to be dispensed into. And it will shut off automatically if you forget to power it off.
3. It's got a clear reservoir for water, so it keeps the process simple.
4. It's extremely quite. The old Keurig yelled at us. You could hear it making that beastly Keurig groaning from across the house. The K-Slim is a stealth coffee maker. I can sit at the kitchen table 12 feet away and forget I'm making coffee until the aroma wafts over to me. It is amazingly quiet, especially if you've ever owned an older Keurig model. I'd dare say this model is as quiet as a traditional drip coffeemaker.
5. This Multi-Stream Technology is the real deal. It is exactly what I hoped it would be. Precisely as advertised. The coffee it makes, and I'm talking about a 12 oz. cup, has the strength and body and rich flavor I could never achieve with the old Keurig. It. Is. Glorious.
6. This creature costs half of what I paid for my original Keurig. So, you're getting an awesome deal here.

Cons:
1. It doesn't have red flames painted on the side.
2. It never replies to my texts.

That's all I could think of.",false,false,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yVpzAHFML.jpg

I think their demands bordered on harassment or making warranty claim as difficult as possible. Product was registered with them and they verified with the serial number. Pretty absurd to suggest info provided for warranty purposes was made up.. Product durability doesn’t warrant going thru that complicated a deception to scam a replacement. Last Keurig I’ll ever buy for any reason. Amazon should look into why Keurig would make it so difficult to stand behind a product in Amazons inventory.

Follow up: Keurig eventually approved warranty claim but doesn’t change rating. This model seems to have reliability issues, ours only lasted 8 months.

Got it home and unpacked it. Rearranged my counter, set-up the Keurig, and added the water to ""cleanse"" the inside of the machine out. Worked great. The next morning I brewed my first cup.
